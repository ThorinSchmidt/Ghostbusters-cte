Readers ofthis section who are subjects oftheCrown can sdue themselues a bit of time byskipping ouer the following two paragraphs.For othzrs, a little explanation is in order.;'. It is all too easy, scientific objectiuity notwithstanding,for a researcher into spirits to assume thatthe legends associated with his natiue country aresomehow rnore rational, rnore plausible, and at thesame tim,e more interesting than the stori,es handeddown am.ong the people of othnr cultures or countries.If onz is not careful this prejudice, no matter how- - strongly it is suppressed, ce,n creep into the tone of a - ^ . - - ;g e ' :': 1 jouflr,al entry as surely and insidiously as the spiritsmselues creep into the liues of deseruing and undei:':With that prefatory note,I acknowl.edge that theresearch Shrewsbury and I haue done into the spiritsaf Great Britain and Western Europe rnay beunauoidably tainted by our inna.te British perspectiue.I assure the read.er that we will striue to keep allsuch coloration from our characterizations ofothers'aecounts. We will striue... but nonetheless, we willfail.Accounts of thc appeara.nces of spirits in WesternEurope lwue two signifi.cant characteristics in common.They are stories told by simple, unassurningfolk-the sort who haue no pretensions, no need tofalsely impress the listener. And the subjects of thesestories follow oft-repeated themes-themes that areheard in places hundreds of miles apart and remouedfromone anotherby years, if notd.ecadesT. heg eneralconclusions that one logically draws from these factsare likewise twofold: One, the stories are as real as thesackcloth from which a farmer's wife makes her dressand as true as the plain countenances-uncmbellishedby wigs, cosrnetics, and other trappings--of ;the people who tell thern. And two, the spirits are ueryactiue in this part of the world. They hop frorn personto person the way a fl,ea might frolic in a crowd ofdogs, and in this fashion can couer a large stretch ofterritory in a uery short span of time.That obseruation leads us to a point of speculation:With ernigration across the Atlantic to the milk-andhoneyland of Am.erica growing in popularity anxongEuropeans almost by the day, I should not be surprisedto awaken from the sleep of the graue ndnyd.ecadesh encea ncl discouert hat those United States(if they are still, at that point, United) are beset by thesame hauntings, annoyances, and depredations thathaue plagu.ed the Old Country. WilI it still, then, be - ^ ;a Meccaf or thosew ho think themseluesd owntroddnn eor oppressed? Tim,e will tell... as it always does.
