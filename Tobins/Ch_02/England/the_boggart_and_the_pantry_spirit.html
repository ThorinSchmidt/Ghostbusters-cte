<h4>The Boggart and the Pantry Spirit</h4>
	
<p>These spirits seem to be related to The Restless People (see elsewhere in this 
section) in terms of their capacity for mischief, but boggarts are a breed unto 
themselves. They do their work indoors, for the most part, and appear to be 
motivated by nothing other than the great glee they receive from tormenting their 
poor victims.</p>

<p>When a boggart first insinuates itself into a household, it wreaks its mischief 
in innocuous ways, so that its presence remains undetected for quite some time. 
This is the stage during which, for no apparent reason, a child's bowl of pudding 
tips and spills its on the head of the family dog. The animal rises up and scurries 
frantically around the room, all while sending gobs of pudding in every direction. 
The episode ends when the dog gets underfoot and trips the master of the house, or
when it careens into a table and sends a family heirloom crashing to the floor.</p>

<p>Is all of this the child's fault? Of course not - but parents seem to need to 
attach a cause to every effect, and so they punish the child for committing the 
original sin of not holding tightly onto his bowl. The boy is caned, or sent to 
bed, or both; perhaps, for good measure, the poor dog is whipped and thrown 
outside. And the boggart crouches invisibly in a corner, cackling silently to 
itself.</p>

<p>The longer a boggart remains undetected, the more sure of itself the spirit 
becomes - and, indeed, there is evidence to suggest that its ability to avoid 
expulsion becomes stronger. At some point when the boggart decides that it can 
move beyond the stage of innocuous pranks, it begins to perform trickery for which
there can be no logical explanation.</p>

<p>Actions that fall into this category include causing the father's and mother's 
bed to shake back and forth in the middle of the night; "redecorating" a home 
while the family is asleep, so that upon awakening they discover chairs on top of 
tables, pictures hung upside down, the fireplace impeccably clean and its ashes 
strewn everywhere but where they should be; or setting the shutters of every window 
in the house to flapping and banging, even thoogh the woman of the house is positive 
that all the shutters were closed and locked before she came to bed. It is
at this point that the members of the household should start to suspect that 
something strange and supernatural is afoot. They still have a chance to be rid of 
the boggart - But only if they do not voice their suspicions, and do not show any 
extreme emotion (fear, anger, despair) at what is happening to them andt heir home. 
The boggart thrives on being noticed, you see; if one does not give it the attention 
it seeks, it eventually becomes bored and disenchanted, and departs to seek out 
someone who reacts "properly" to its trickery.</p>

<p>The Pantry Spirit seems to be a sort of specialized boggart, whose interest and 
influence is limited to the places in the home where food is stored. Like the 
oggart, it begins with covert actions - gobbling half a loaf of bread or half a 
pint of rum, so that the next time the owner goes to the breadbox or the bottle, he
or she may not even notice what's missing; or, if he does, he thinks nothing of 
it.<.p>

<p>From there it proceeds to pilfering the entire contents of some container and 
leaving the empty sack, bottle, or box behind as its signature. Locking the 
cupboard does no good, of course, since the spirit is insubstantial as well as 
invisible. Hiding food is equally fruitless (no pun intended), for the spirit can 
sniff it out no matter where it is put.</p>

<p>If the home owner fails to conceal his anger, fear, or apprehension, the spirit 
launches a full-scale attack on all ofthe edibles in the house. It cannot consume 
anything while that object is observed, but behind the victim's back the spirit may 
be rapidly and silently gobbling his entire store of vegetables.</p>

<p>When is its appetite satisfied? At the moment when every bit of food on the 
premises has disappeared, when the cupboard is as bare as bare can be, the spirit 
lets loose with a loud, disgusting belch and goes away.</p>

<p>But perhaps not very far away. If the larder was stocked with anything other 
than the most mundane of staples, it might remain in the vicinity for a day or two 
to see how the shelves are replenished. If the victim returns from the market with 
exotic liquors, pastries, and other sorts of delicacies, the spirit lets itself back 
in and starts the process all over again.</p>

<p>Boggarts and their gluttonous cousins are not life-threatening spirits, but they 
can do more to disrupt and disintegrate a household with their long-term visits than 
a truly horrific spirit can do with one brief, blood-curdling appearance.</p>
