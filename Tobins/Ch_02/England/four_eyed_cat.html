<h4>The Four Eyed Cat</h4>
	
<p>As one story attempting to explain this spirit goes, a haughty lass lured an
impressionable young fisherman away from his betrothed. She did it only for spite,
and not out of enmity for the other girl, whom she didn't even know.</p>

<p>The young man, smitten and having a hard time controlling his palpitations, 
invited her to come along the next day on the fishing boat. At daybreak she hid 
beneath a tarpaulin. She was still there six hours later, sweating and fretting 
because her paramour had not got away from his duty to dally with her.</p>

<p>But alas forthe lass, her adventurernevergot the opportunity. A furious storm 
blew up, and the ship and all hands (including the feminine ones) were lost without 
a trace. When the grieving townsfolk noticed the girl's absence, they guessed that 
she had been a passenger on the unlucky vessel. They put two and two together and
came to the only logical conelusion: if the girl had not been aboard, the boat
would not have sunk.</p>

<p>The spirit of that girl, in the guise of a four-eyed cat, is liable to be found 
in any body of water. Since her human incarnation did not surive, reasons the 
spirit, then neither shall any woman who goes along for the ride ever see the safety
of port again.</p>

<p>Most fishermen to this dav will not take a woman aboard. And at the end of the
day's work, before the catch is weighed and sold, the crew throw a few morsels back
overboard. "For the cat," they explain if a landlubber asks. And then they say no
more.</p>
