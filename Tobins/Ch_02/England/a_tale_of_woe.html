<h4>A Tale of Woe</h4>
	
<p>The home of a farmer in Yorkshire was plagued by a boggart. The man, apparently
somewhat familiar with how these spirits were said to operate, told his wife in 
secret that they should not appear to be distressed by any of the calamities that 
were befalling them. Instead, he said, they would begin packing and making plans to 
move, as though this had been their intention all along. He was sure that as soon 
as they vacated the property, the spirit would be convinced that they were gone for
good - whereupon it would go away, and they would be able to reoccupy their 
home.</p>

<p>The farmer made but one terrible mistake. Just as he and his wife were loading 
the last of their belongings into a wagon, but before they stepped all the way off 
their plot of land, the man was approached by a neighbor, who expressed surprise 
and sorrow that the two of them were leaving. Thinking that he would not be 
overheard because he was outside the house, the farmer explained the truth of the 
matter: they really had no place to go, but were pretending to leave so as to trick the spirit into
abandoning them. All of a sudden the air was split by a harsh giggle and a single 
statement that chilled the farmer to the bone. "Well, well," the disembodied voice 
said, seeming to come from a point just behind the man's shoulder. "If ye're not 
really leavin', then neither am I."</p>

<p>Then came another peal of laughter, fading into the distance as the spirit moved 
back toward - and into - the house.</p>
