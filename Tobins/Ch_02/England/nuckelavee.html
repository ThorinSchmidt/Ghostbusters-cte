<h4>Nuckelavee</h4>
	
<p>A textual description of this spirit's appearance cannot possibly do it 
	justice. As we were told by many of the eyewitnesses with whom we spoke, the
	only way to really know what Nuckelavee looks like is to encounter the thing 
	- and in the next breath, they tell us the knowledge is not worth what it 
	takes to find it out. The spirit always appears at night, and seems at first 
	sight to be a man-shape astride a horse. Some viewers insist that the man's
	body and the horse's are somehow welded together. The most striking aspect of 
	the man-shape as seen from a distance is the size of its head - three feet in
	diameter, perched atop a massive set of shoulders. The head rocks from side to
	side on the shoulders, as though it is not attached to them but is rolling 
	back and forth between the clavicles.</p>

<p>As the thing approaches closer, an observant viewer may see that the horse - 
	body has flippers instead of hooves - an anatomical grotesquery that does not 
	seem to prevent the creature from moving  overland with good speed - and 
	extremely long arms.</p>

<p>The features of its face are gruesome to behold: a single red eye in the 
	middle of the forehead, and a giant, gaping, slavering mouth that easily opens
	to accommodate the head of a normal man. And then comes the most spine-
	chilling revelation of all: the man-body of Nuckelavee has no skin! The outer 
	surface of the head, torso, and arms is raw red flesh, resembling nothing so 
	much as freshly cut beef in a slaughterhouse. Blood of a darker red color 
	(some say it is black) can be seen pulsing through translucent yellow veins 
	and arteries, and grayish white sinew is visible in the places where it occurs
	in human anatomy. Even if Nuckelavee were "only" a man in all other respects,
	this absence of epidermis alone would make the creature a horrifying sight.
	</p>

<p>The flipper-feet of the horse-body can move silently if Nuckelavee so 
	desires, enabling the thing to surprise an intended victim. It rarely 
	approaches from behind, however, apparently preferring to bring teffor upon 
	its quarry gradually.</p>

<p>If the victim is shocked enough or brave enough or stupid enough to stand his
	ground while Nuckelavee closes to arm's length, the monster unleashes an 
	attack that no one can withstand: its breath. The odor that it can expel from 
	its mouth at will gives new meaning to the word "noxious." Even the most 
	insensitive nose is assailed by the smell, and virtually any person turns and 
	flees rather than continue to subject himself to the stench. It has often been
	likened to the smell of a decaying corpse, while others (who probably had not 
	been exposed to that particular smell) describe it simply as the odor of 
	something rotten or dead.</p>

<p>Nuckelavee's purpose seems to be to extract terror from its victim, as though
	it somehow thrives on emanations of horror. (My colleague Shrewsbury Smith has
	a different theory concerning what Nuckelavee is after, but, with all due 
	respect to him, the idea is so preposterous that I cannot bring myself to even
	mention it.) If the victim turns and runs - and this is almost impossible not 
	to do - Nuckelavee chases him, its mouth twisted into a semblance of a smile.
	The pursuit continues until the victim passes out from exhaustion (an 
	unconscious person cannot be terrified), acquires serious (or even mortal!) 
	injury during flight, or flees across a body of fresh water that Nuckelavee 
	cannot circumvent.</p>

<p>This last point is a very interesting aspect of Nuckelavee's nature. For a 
	reason that we are still trying to ascertain, the monster cannot abide fresh
	water and does anything to keep from coming into contact with it.</p>
