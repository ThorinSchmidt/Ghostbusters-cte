  <p>As will be apparent to the student who reads this work, and perhaps delve
    into some of the books written by my esteemed colleagues, not all denizens 
    of the spirit world are evil-minded. In fact, some of them, which we refer
    to here collectively as the Grateful Ghosts, have nothing but the best of 
    intentions toward the humans with whom they consort.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately for them and for us, it can be quite diffrcult to tell when a
    spirit is tryrng to be helpful, so a lot of their efforts go unappreciated.
    We have never heard tell of a Grateful Ghost that explained itself, or even
    spoke for the purpose of reassuring the beneficiary of its good deed; 
    apparently, these spirits are content to let their actions speak for 
    themselves. The problem, from our mortal point of view, is that their 
    actions can be very difficult to decipher.</p>

  <p>If a ghost appears before a person in a posture that seems threatening, is 
    it trying to put terror in his heart, or is it trying to warn him that if he
    proceeds along his path, he will come to trouble?</p>

  <p>None of this is meant to suggest that one should try to attach an honorable
    motive to anything a spirit might do - but neither should one assume that 
    every ghost, specter, wraith, or unseen force is set on scaring, 
    embarrassing, or hurting one.</p>

<p>A Favor Returned</p>

<p><i>they aim to please</i></p>

<p>Each of these spirits can read minds (to figure out how a victim needs help,
  if that isn't obvious), and materialize lf necessary (so they can use Muscles
  or Moues). Each Grateful Ghost has specific talents related to the way it 
  gives help. The victim may not want a ghost's help. Okay, fine. All he has to
  do is make a Brains roll that's lower than the ghost's roll for the Trait or
  talent it's using - thereby proving he doesn't know a good thing when he sees
  it (or doesn't see it, as the case may be). The ghost won't get angry or feel
  bad, but word does have a way of getting around the spirit world, and no 
  Grateful Ghost will ever again try to do a good deed for that person.</p>
