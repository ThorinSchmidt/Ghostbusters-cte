<h4>Grateful Ghosts</h4>
	
<p>As will be apparent to the student who reads this work, and perhaps delves into 
some of the books written by my esteemed colleagues, not all denizens of the spirit 
world are evil-minded. In fact, some of them, which we refer to here collectively 
as the Grateful Ghosts, have nothing but the best of intentions toward the humans 
with whom they consort.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for them and for us, it can be quite diffrcult to tell when a 
spirit is tryrng to be helpful, so a lot of their efforts go unappreciated. We have
never heard tell of a Grateful Ghost that explained itself, or even spoke for the 
purpose of reassuring the beneficiary of its good deed; apparently, these spirits
are content to let their actions speak for themselves. The problem, from our mortal
point of view, is that their actions can be very difficult to decipher.</p>

<p>If a ghost appears before a person in a posture that seems threatening, is it 
trying to put terror in his heart, or is it trying to warn him that if he proceeds 
along his path, he will come to trouble?</p>

<p>None of this is meant to suggest that one should try to attach an honorable 
motive to anything a spirit might do - but neither should one assume that every 
ghost, specter, wraith, or unseen force is set on scaring, embarrassing, or 
hurting one.</p>
