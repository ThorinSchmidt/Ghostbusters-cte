<h4>Tregeagle</h4>
	
<p>The name is an innocuous one, but the spirit who possesses it is one of the 
	most terrible, vengeful, thoroughly evil apparitions this world has ever 
	known.</p>

<p>John Tregeagle was a corrupt magistrate in Cornwall who, as near as we can 
	determine, had no friends and desired none. He spent his life fighting and 
	revenging himself on his enemies, of which he had many. His lust for vengeance
	was so strong that, according to quite reliable accounts, several years after
	Tregeagle's death, the man's ghost appeared to testify against one of his old
	enemies at the court of Bodmin (a municipality in the county of Cornwall).</p>

<p>Here occurred the mistake that loosed the malign spirit of John Tregeagle 
	upon the world - for not only did the eourt permit the ghost to testify, but
	it turned out that the defendant was convicted on the strength of Tregeagle's 
	avowals, where otherwise the man would have been set free. Whether the court
	believed Tregeagle's testimony out of terror or because of the substance of
	the words is unknown and ultimately immaterial. The important thing is that
	Tregeagle was given credibility, and with credibility came power.</p>

<p>Tregeagle's ghost roams the world on a quest for vengeance. In particular, he
	has an insatiable hatred for the descendants of the enemies he accumulated
	during his life, but in general he does not hesitate to wreak havoc and misery
	upon any individual so luckless as to attract his attention.</p>

<p>Churchmen have exorcised Tregeagle on several occasions, but rather than 
	succeeding in banishing him permanently from the material world, they have 
	only managed to stifle him temporarily by chaining him to the completion of 
	some never-ending task. He has been compelled to empty a bottomless pool using
	a leaky bucket; to sweep the sands from the British Channel into the Atlantic 
	Ocean, while they were continually being brought back to their origin by the 
	prevailing cunent; to catch a ray of light in a glass jar and keep it there 
	for 24 hours.</p>

<p>On every occasion when he has been kept occupied thusly, he has eventually 
	succeeded in breaking his bonds after years of toil - and then he is free to 
	hunt again, even more vicious and vindictive than he had been before.</p>

<p>When Tregeagle makes himself visible, he appears as a skeletal, thoroughly 
	evil-looking man dressed only in the shroud his body wore when it was buried. 
	When he manifests himself in this fashion, he speaks to his victim and 
	identifies himself by name. Anyone who does not give him the respect and 
	deference he demands - who does not let out a bloodcurdling shriek, drop into 
	a faint, or run pell-mell in the opposite direction - may in all likelihood 
	not live long enough to regret his or her indiscretion.</p>
	
<p>If someone he visits professes to be, or actually is, not horribly frightened
	by his presence, then it is quite possible that person will be struck dead on 
	the spot. We make this inference because, in all of our interviews and 
	research, we have yet to encounter a single person who claimed to have seen 
	Tregeagle and not to have been utterly horrified. Thus, either such an event 
	has never happened (unlikely, considering the wide range of behavior and 
	mentality among members of the human race), or when it has happened, the 
	victim has not survived to tell about it.</p>

<p>Sometimes, for no reason other than pure malevolence, Tregeagle simply 
	reaches out from the spirit world and takes a life on a whim. All of us are
	familiar with stories of sudden, unexplainable deaths - the man in perfect 
	health who keels over in the middle of his morning constitutional; the woman,
	likewise free of illness or infirmity, who closes her eyes to go to sleep one
	night and never wakes up again.</p>

<p>I submit, with all due respect to the members of the medical community, that 
	there is one cause of death they will never be able to foresee or identify, at
	least not through their brand of scholarship. And that is death brought about 
	by the wantonly evil act of a spirit - Tregeagle or some other one that shares
	his disregard for earthly life.</p>
