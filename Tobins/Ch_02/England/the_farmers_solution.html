<h4>The Farmer's Solution</h4>
	
<p>There is one way to foil The Sexton, a method that was accidentally stumbled 
	upon by a solitary farmer. One of his three cows took sick and appeared to be 
	on the verge of death. Thinking ahead, he dug a shallow grave and meant to
	bury the animal as soon as it expired so that the corpse would not infect the
	other cows. He realized that not all the dirt he had excavated would fit back 
	into the hole when the cow was put within. So, proud of himself for his 
	ingenuity, he took away a volume of earth roughly equal to that of the body of
	the cow and used it to re-cover the floor of his cabin.</p>

<p>A day went by, then two, then a week, and still the cow survived - not only
	survived, but seemed to recover.</p>

<p>The next day he was visited by some pilgrims, who were quite upset to 
	discover what was obviously an open grave. "Know ye not of The Sexton?" they
	asked. The farmer shook his head in confusion. After the pilgrims explained
	to him about the spirit, the farmer told them the story of the cow that didn't
	die.</p>

<p>And thus it became known that if a grave is dug, but a significant amount of
	the loose earth is promptly taken away from the site, The Sexton can be 
	thereby thwarted. The spirit is left with a dilemma: in order to fill the 
	preexisting hole, The Sexton would be forced to dig some fresh earth of its 
	own - and then that new hole, by virtue of its own stricture, would need to be
	filled by the body of The Sexton. Since a spirit cannot harm itself (a 
	universal characteristic only humans seem to violate), the hole remains a 
	hole, and The Sexton is obliged to find another venue for its dirtv deed.</p>
