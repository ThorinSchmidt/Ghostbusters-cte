<h4>The Spectral Voyager</h4>
	
<p>So many accounts involving this type of spirit have been reported, and so 
	many other incidents are theoretically attributable to its existence, that one
	singular fact is undeniably clear: a great number of these spirits inhabit our
	world. People - particularly those who live or visit in urban areas - must be
	constantly on the lookout for them. They patrol the streets and byways 
	endlessly and are utterly indiscriminate about what sorts of folk they abduct,
	although their victims most often seem to be those who are impetuous or of low
	intelligence.</p>

<p>By way of further explanation and elucidation, I defer to my colleague 
	Shrewsbury Smith, who claims (and I believe him implicitly) to have had an 
	experience with a spirit of this sort. I am indebted to Mrs. Ann Tickwoodie 
	for her skill at transcription, by dint of which the reader may be assured 
	that the account which follows this entry is accurate down to the last 
	syllable.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith's tale is typical, in most respects, of the dozens of similar 
	occurrences we have heard about and read about during our researeh into the 
	voyage. An anonymous driver or horseman approaches a solitary pedestrian and
	offers transportation. Those solicited are free to decline, and if they do,
	nothing untoward happens to them. As for those who accept, that is another 
	matter altogether; we have never heard from a person who took a ride from such
	a mysterious stranger and then returned to tell about it later.</p>

<p>Thanks to the large body of information we have on sightings, we can draw 
	some rather specific conclisions about the sort of people who decline the 
	rider's assistance. They turn down the offer either because they are 
	perspicacious enough (as Mr. Smith was) to realize the danger, or simply 
	because they have no real need for the spirit's "services."</p>

<p>Conversely, we can deduce that those who do accept fall into the opposite 
	categories. The man who disappeared on the night of Mr. Smith's experi-ence
	was at least slightly besotted, which may have dulled his judgment, and 
	without meaning disrespect we mighi theorize that - even when sober, he was
	not a man of great intellectual prowess. The barmaid may have been cautious 
	about rides from strangers - an attitude that any woman in the city is well 
	advised to adopt - but in this case, she was in a great hurry and may have 
	decided that the risk of danger from the coachman was smaller than the 
	possibility of incurring her employer's wrath for failing to report to work on
	time.</p>

<p>As to the intentions and motivation of this spirit, we have a clue in the 
	substance of what the coachman said to Mr. Smith - which, again, is similar or
	identical to the dialogues that other people have reported. When the driver
	offers to take a pedestrian to his or her "destination," he refers not to the
	journey of the moment but to the ultimate destination at which all of us, 
	sooner or later, must arrive - the end of our corporeal earthly existence.</p>

<p>What happens to those who accept the assistance of a Spectral Voyager? 
	Obviously, we cannot know this for sure - but just as obviously, they do 
	disappear and they probably do die, at least in one sense of the word. The 
	consensus among my fellow researchers, a view which I share, suggests that 
	each victim in turn takes the place of the driver, and the spirit of the 
	previous coachman is thereby allowed to enjoy its final and eternal rest.</p>

<p>Of course, this leaves open the questions of how and why the original 
	Spectral Voyager came to be, and why this type of spirit seems to be so 
	proliferate. Conjecture is pointless here, for there exist as many different 
	theories as there are scholars of the subject. My friend Shrewsbury, when 
	asked for his thoughts on these topics, evinces perhaps the most sensible
	attitude of all: "What difference does it make?"</p>

<h5>Editot's Note</h5>

<p>The years since Tobin conducted his research have seen an explosion in the 
	number and variety of vehicles for hire. While some spectral voyagers still 
	appear in driving capes and handsom(sic) cabs, it is not uncommon to hear 
	tales of phantom taxis, motor boats, or even charter planes, depending upon
	one's location and the availability of transportation. It would be no surprise
	to discover a spectral voyager plying a Venetian Gondola or a rickshaw in Hong
	Kong.</p>
