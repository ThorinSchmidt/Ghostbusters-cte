<blockquote>
<h4>The Sexton</h4>
	
<p>This is a spirit that believes (to paraphrase The Bard) that all the world's
	a grave, and the ultimate purpose of any person is to fill a hole-with his or 
	her own body.</p>

</p>If a person digs a hole in the ground for any reason, such action attracts 
	the notice of The Sexton if the spirit is in the vicinity. The spirit wants 
	the hole fiIled in, but the entity is not without patience; it can wait a day 
	or two until appearing in physical form before the person who did the digging.
	</p>

<p>The Sexton manifests itself as a frail man dressed in a black suit, with a 
	shock of snow-white hair atop its head. It beckons to the digger, entrances 
	the person, and compels him or her to follow The Sexton to the grave site, 
	whereupon the spirit materializes a shovel, knocks the offender into the hole,
	and fills the excavation with dirt.</p>
