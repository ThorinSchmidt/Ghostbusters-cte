  <p>We relate here the story of a coachman in northern England. In the distant
    past, he had rescued a woman from the side of the road, and seen her safely
    to the nearest village free of charge. The woman was most appreciative, and
    hoped they would stay in contact. When the coachman tried to look her up on
    his next trip, he was shocked to discover that she had died of a brief but 
    virulent illness.</p>

  <p>He quickly got over his grief (for, after all, he hardly knew the woman) 
    and soon forgot her. Then one day he was hired in Durham. Four men needed to
    get to York by eight o'clock that evening, and they promised a fee of 10 
    times his normal rate if he could accommodate them. He knew he would need to
    drive the horses hard, but he accepted the fare.</p>

  <p>Seven miles south of Durham the coach ran into a vast expanse of dense fog,
    and the driver had to slow the horses to a trot. The wind was driving the 
    fog in their direction, so that the coach might well go all the way to York 
    without ever breaking free of it. The prospect of the eight o'clock deadline
    seemed bleak indeed.</p>

  <p>Suddenly a ghostly figure appeared on the seat beside the driver and 
    grabbed the reins from him. It was the woman he had helped years earlier! 
    She snapped the reins, and the horses broke into a gallop.</p>

  <p>A normal driver, even the best one, could not have sustained such a speed 
    through the fog without incurring a terrible mishap. But, as the coachman 
    quickly realized, this was no ordinary driver next to him. The fog did 
    indeed persist all the way to York, but she guided the coach unerringly, and
    brought the passengers to their destination with minutes to spare.</p>

  <p>The driver was petrified, and if the coachman was afraid, we can only 
    imagine what the passengers must have been thinking. But when all was said
    and done, the four men were extremely thankful, and they spoke well of him 
    to potential customers every chance they got.</p>

  <p>The coachman was not about to admit that it was not he who had done the 
    driving. "They'd've thought me a fool," he said, "and even if they believed
    me, it'd've been bad for business. So I kep' me mouth shut." And at some 
    later time, before he related his story, he put the final piece of the 
    puzzle into place. The woman had returned to repay him for his service to 
    her. She accomplished something he never could have done by himself... even
    if her methods were rather unorthodox.</p>
