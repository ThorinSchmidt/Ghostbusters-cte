<h4>Smith's Encounter</h4>
	
<p>"In London, I stayed overlong at the home of a friend one evening - don't 
	even ask, Tobin - and when I emerged, the night was dark and starry under a 
	new moon. I could not find a cab in short order, but the air was clear and the
	temperature not unpleasant, so I resolved to walk the two miles or so to my 
	apartment."</p>

<p>"When one is not accustomed to traveling on foot, as I freely admit I am not,
	it can be refreshing to see the streets from a viewpoint of narrower scope. I 
	was not nervous. but still my eyes darted to and fro - left, right, over my 
	shoulder - for the puroose of taking in the details of my surroundings and at
	the same time ensuring that nothing and no one should approach me unobserved."
	</p>

<p>"The walkway at streetside was fraught with perils both annoying and amusing,
	occasionally unsettling. After nearly slipping on or stumbling over a host of 
	obstacles, including a half-eaten chicken leg, a cobblestone that vandals had 
	pried out of place, a dead cat, and an unconscious miscreant who reeked of 
	wine, I decided that the street - even for someone without a cab or coach - 
	was a safer and therefore better place to be."</p>

<p>"I could feel, rather than see, the quizzical looks of the other pedestrians
	as I resolutely stepped into the street, paced off a distance equal to half 
	its width, and resumed my stroll right down the center of the boulevard. Of
	course, there is no law against walking in the street - just as there is no 
	law against a horse - drawn conveyance trampling someone walking in its 
	rigtful path. But at this time of night, street traffic was thin to 
	nonexistent. It was no problem to simply step out of the way when a coach 
	driver or a cartsman demanded the space I was occupying, and it was easy to 
	ignore the imprecations and assumptions about my heritage that were flung in 
	my direction bv the drivers whose territory I had invaded. I could have saved
	myself some grief of a different sort by abandoning the thoroughfare, but now
	it had become a mission: I was determined to make my way home along any path I
	pleased, so long as it did not involve intruding on private property. The 
	street belonged to me as much as it did to any horse and driver, and the only
	impediments to footloose travel here were occasional piles of dung, which I 
	assume were of equine origin...."</p>

<p>"I'm getting to it, Tobin, I'm getting to it. A story ouht to have some 
	flavor, don't you think?... Well, I don't care what you think! This is my 
	story and I'll tell it in my own good time. No doubt you'll put it in your 
	journal the way you see fit anyway, so the least you can do is let me tell it.
	Or maybe I should save it for my own journal, y'know? 'Shrewsbury Smith and 
	His Amazing Adventures' - has a nice ring to it, eh?... Well, so it might be a
	short book, but it'd be a good one!"</p>

<p>"All right then, back to it. I'm more than halfway home when a carriage turns
	the corner a few yards in front of me. Everything about it was black - a deep
	black that showed up even against the night. I gave way, having developed a 
	nimble shufffng sidestep just for this purpose, and I kept the coach visible
	in the corner of my eye as I continued to walk in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>"The horse was black from mane to hooves, nose to tail. The coach was plain, 
	the color and luster of cold pitch. The driver was attired in black hat, coat,
	and leggings, his face obscured - unnecessarily, I thought, considering the 
	far trom inclement weather - by the collar of the coat, which was turned up 
	against the sides and back of his head, and the brim of the hat, which was 
	pulled down as though he were trying to keep the nonexistent rainfall out of
	his eyes.</p>

<p>"Lots of things are black, of course, and I took no special note of the 
	vehicle's appearance then. Most noteworthy to me was the fact that this 
	driver, unlike all the others I had encountered, paid me no heed whatsoever. 
	He did not curse me or my parentage, he did not cause his horse to veer 
	threateningly toward me as the other louts had done. He steered a straight 
	course, apparently oblivious to me as well as to the rest of his surroundings
	- so oblivious it crossed my mind that he might have run the animal and the 
	vehicle rieht over me if I had not altered my path to let him pass. Despite 
	this unnerving observation, I found the whole incident curious rather than 
	foreboding, and no doubt would have forgotten about it forthwith, except for 
	what happened next."</p>

<p>"The coach turned another corner behind me, to my right - I could tell from 
	the sound - and disappeared from sight and mind. But no more than three 
	minutes later, there it was again, approaching me - from the left! - along an
	intersectg street. Having heard nothing as I approached the intersection, I 
	did not bother to look ieft and right, as good mothers have admonished their 
	children to do ever since there were streets. And so I did not notice the 
	black coach that must have been standing there, a few houses distant, just 
	before the horse was ordered onward."</p>

<p>"At the time, I assumed that it had been standing there. Now, thanks to what
	you've gotten me into, Tobin, I know - or, at least, I suppose differently. It
	was the same coach: of that there was no doubt in mv mind, even though simple
	reason demanded another explanation. How, after all, could the vehicle have 
	traveled a circuitous route covering several blocks, with me all the while 
	moving away from it, and then once again happen to be directly in my path? As
	quickly as my mind phrased the question at the time, another part of my brain
	dismissed it and refused to struggle for an answer. Now I know that it had 
	made that journey by means not available to normal horse-drawn coaches. It 
	had... what's the word?... materialized - Thank you, Tobin- in a spot so as to
	be able to encounter me again."</p>

<p>"The coach reached the intersection after I had passed through it by fifty 
	paces or so, and the steady clopping of the horse's hooves turned to follow 
	along the path I had taken. I kept walking, determined to be as oblivious to 
	the coachman as he had been to me, although I did make the prudent concession
	of angling my path towards the side of the street."</p>

<p>"In the next two minutes I learned something about myself that I had never 
	had occasion to discover before. I knew, without being able to attach a reason
	to the feeling, that I was in grave danger. And through the peril, despite it,
	I stayed calm and composed, possessed of no weapons save my rationality. And 
	my rationality told me that to panic and run would do me more ill than good if
	not physical harm, then the worse hurt of always knowing that I had been 
	presented with my moment of truth... and I had run away from it, trembling and
	whimpering as a child does when he escapes from the neighborhood bully-boy."
	</p>

<p>"The coach came closer, and the closer it came, the slower it moved. It took
	enormous force of will for me to keep my pace steady, my eyes forward. As the 
	coach drew alongside me, I turned my head toward it and continued to walk. So
	much for being oblivious - but then again, the driver had obviously noticed 
	me, so it was only polite to reciprocate. Perhaps he needs directions, I 
	thought to myself. Still mindful of my manners, I stopped at precisely the 
	instant that the front wheels of the coach drew even with my progress."</p>

<p>"Emboldened, with an attitude that verged on devil-may-care, I turned further 
	towards the driver, gave a slight bow, and asked with all due civility, 'May I
	be of service?'"</p>

<p>"The driver was still facing forward as I said that, but then, as if on cue,
	he turned his head down and to his left toward me, and, from the visage still
	shrouded by collar and hat, a voice issued forth: 'Nay,' he said, in a tone 
	that seemed somehow expressionless and considerate at the same time. 'But I
	may serve, if it please.'"</p>

<p>"I thought I knew what was coming, but I replied nonetheless. 'In what way?'
	I asked, careful to remain polite but detached. A part of me screamed out to 
	be gone, to put as much distance between myself and this mysterious coachman 
	as my feet would allow. But a larger part of me vowed to see this through. The
	man - if that was what he was - did not seem inclined to force me physically,
	and I felt that I could withstand any other form of persuasion he might bring
	to bear."</p>

<p>"For the first time, the driver moved something other than his head. He took 
	the reins in his right hand and swept the left in the direction of the door of
	the coach. 'Transport to your destination,' he said,'free of charge.'"</p>

<p>"For the blink of an eye, I considered taking him up on the offer, though I 
	had less than half a mile to go. All things considered, particularly the 
	events of the last five minutes or so, I had had quite enough of the 
	pedestrian way of life. But then reason surfaced, and prevailed. 'Thank you,
	no,' I said. 'I haven't far to go.'"</p>

<p>"I waited for what seemed an eternity for the driver to offer a response that
	would spell the end of this odd episode. In reality, it must have been only a 
	second or two.'So you say,' the man replied. Then he teased the reins, and the
	horse set off at a walk. I remained standing, watching, until the coach turned
	at the next cross-street and, within seconds thereafter, the sounds of its 
	hooves and rims against the pavement was(sic) no longer audible."</p>

<p>"It took me a while to get to sleep that night, but when I awoke the incident
	had passed from my mind - or so I thought. In the next evening's newspaper I 
	was alarmed, but not completely surprised, to read that two persons had 
	seemingly disappeared right off the streets of London the previous night. A 
	man was last seen staggering out the door of his favorite pub, but never 
	reached his home six blocks away. A woman dashed from her apartment, late for
	work, and failed to report for duty as a barmaid at a nearby tavern. Both
	incidents took place in the same neighborhood through which I had walked."
	</p>

<p>"Being a conscientious citizen, I contacted the police to tell them about the
	mysterious coachman. They were polite and attentive, but as far as I know 
	never drew a connection between the man in black and the disappearances. 
	'Can't be a crime without a body,' a lieutenant told me - a rather simplistic
	point of view, I thought. 'It's a big city,' he felt behooved to add.'People 
	are pickin' up and leavin' all the time; we ean't be keepin' track o'them as 
	doesn't want to be found.'"</p>

<p>"I nodded, thanked the officer for his time, and took my leave. To this day 
	I've never seen the black coach again - but then, I've not made a habit of 
	strolling the streets after dark, either."</p>
