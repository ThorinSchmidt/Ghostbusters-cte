<h4>Foundation Sacrifice</h4>
	
<p>This kind of spirit is found throughout the civilized world, because the 
	practice that spawns it is not unique to any geographic area or culture. 
	However, nowhere has the presence of such a spirit had more effect on people's
	lives - and deaths - than in the village of Klosters in extreme eastern 
	Switzerland.</p>
	
<p>In the mid-fifteenth century, Hans Upp was the village idiot of Klosters. An 
	inoffensive sort, as most idiots are, Hans had no family and no real friends, 
	he was considered expendable when the time for an... expenditure.</p>
	
<p>The village fathers authorized construction of a new government hall - the 
	fourth such building that the village was forced to erect in 10 years. The 
	earlier three had all fallen apart within months after they were frnished, for
	sundry defrciencies in their construction.</p>

<p>One of the council members, a well-traveled man who had settled in the 
	village after the erection and destruction of buildings two and three, 
	advanced an idea that rapidly won acceptance. In addition to all the physical 
	safeguards they could build into this new project, he suggested that they 
	needed some spiritual insurance.</p>

<p>In his journeys to exotic lands such as Bulgaria and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the
	man had seen many majestic structures that had stood for longer than any of
	the town residents could remember. He learned that, grisly though it sounded,
	the townspeople firmly believed the reason the buildings remained strong was 
	that, to appease the Earth for building such a large and unnatural structure,
	a human being had been interred in each one during its construction - a live 
	human being!</p>

<p>The village leaders, desperate that some malady should not befall their 
	latest attempt to house themselves in splendor, agreed that they had nothing
	to lose. Hans Upp's designation as the sacrificial lamb was the result of a 
	logical, if cruel, line of reasoning. Klosters could indeed get along without
	him, but (in a sadistic way) the villagers would miss him. The perfect 
	sacrifice.</p>

<p>Of course, the councilmen resolved, the deed would have to be kept secret 
	from all except a few of the workers (who would be paid handsomely for 
	executing the task... and the man). Not everyone in the village would agree 
	that Hans had to die this way.</p>

<p>Ground was broken for the new structure. Hans visited the site every day, 
	fascinated by the excavation work for as long as his attention span would
	allow. Stone blocks were hauled from the quarry, and the foundation was laid -
	save for one corner, which had been set aside for Hans's tomb. But how 	could
	the workers induce Hans to stand in that corner while they built stone walls 
	all around him?</p>

<p>The foreman accosted Hans one night and invited him to help with an important
	part of the job.</p>

<p>"Stand here," the foreman said, indicating the unfinished corner. "We need 
	you to tell us whether the stones are fitting together tightly on your side of
	the wall. If you see any light coming through between stones, tap on the wall
	and tell us. Otherwise, stay quiet."</p>

<p>Those instructions may have been almost too complicated for Hans to 
	comprehend. Nonetheless, he did stand where he was told. The wall went up 
	quickly; the three men working on it cerbainly wanted to get this unsavory 
	task over with as soon as they could. The stone blocks, each weighing as much
	as a man, were lowered into position and snugged up against their neighbors.
	</p>

<p>When the wall was as high as his chin, Hans spoke for the first time.</p>

<p>"Dark," he said-meaning, of course, that the workmen had done a perfect job
	fitting the stones. No light... and no air... could penetrate between them. 
	The frnal row of blocks was laid: now the wall was barely higher than Hans's
	head, and it was time for the denouement. The hoist ropes were slipped around
	an enorrnous slab that would serve as a one-piece ceiling for the tomb.</p>
	
<p>Before he saw the slab, Hans raised his artns over his head and grunted. To 
	the anonymous workman who witnessed the gesture (and from whose journal the 
	details of this account are taken), Hans was clearly asking to be lifted out
	of the hole.</p>

<p>Then the slab was moved into place above him, and the two workers on the 
	ropes played them out slowly, lowering the stone. Hans looked up and, 
	according to the eyewitness to his frnal moments, a look of awareness - of
	recognition-came over his face for perhaps the frrst time in years.</p>

<p>Poor Hans gave up. He dropped his arms and lowered his gaze, looking directly
	into the eyes of the workman who would be responsible for making sure the slab
	was properly positioned when it finally came to rest.</p>

<p>If Hans spoke any final words or sounds in the last instant before he was 
	entombed, they were drowned out by the crash of stone on stone when the 
	guideropes were slipped away and the slab was allowed to fall the last inch or
	two into place.</p>

<p>A few seconds after the tomb was completed, the rapping began. Hans was 
	knocking against the wall, looking for attention or pity or both. But he would
	get neither. The workers stayed for another four hours, unable to ignore the 
	plaintive, muffled rapping but equally unable - and unwilling - to undo what
	they had done. The tapping grew fainter and less frequent. Then it stopped, 
	and poor Hans must have expired soon after.</p>

<p>The building, it should be noted, was completed three months later. It stood
	for almost 200 years, presiding grandly over Klosters - as that village fell
	into a terrible decline. For no reason that anyone could (or would) identify,
	bad tidings began to befall villagers and newcomers alike.</p>

<p>The erection of new buildings and the maintenance of existing structures,
	both of which are so important to any community hoping to avoid stagnation, 
	proved to be not only unwise and fruitless but downright dangerous ventures.
	</p>

<p>The tale survives of a farmer who put a new roof on his barn, only to have
	the walls collapse the day after it was finished, killing all his livestock.
	</p>

<p>A merchant wanted to improve his establishment, adding fresh paint to the 
	storefront. On the night after it was completed, a fire of unknown origin 
	destroyed the shop and killed the owner (who lived on the second floor) 
	without charring a timber of the neighboring stores on either side.</p>

<p>It didn't take long for the villagers to deduce that they were living under
	some sort of curse that struck whenever they tried to repair or improve their
	homes, shops, or outbuildings. Many people left, spreading the word of the
	curse as they dispersed, and a phenomenon arose that can only be described as
	Klostersphobia. For years and years, no new residents settled in the village. 
	Soon only the stone village hall stood tall and straight.</p>

<p>Around the year L652, the leaders of Klosters made a desperate plan to 
	revitalize the near ghost town. Unlike their predecessors of two hundred
	years before, these were good folk, members of families who had lived in the
	village for untold generations, and without realizing it, they found a way to
	subvert the curse of Klosters.</p>

<p>Selecting a new plot of land in a valley several miles away, they financed 
	the construction of several buildings to serve as homes and shops. Then they 
	had the old village hall torn down and its components carted to the new 
	location, where they were reassembled. The skeleton they were astonished to 
	find under one corner of the structure they buried with all pomp and 
	circumstance in the new graveyard. New Klosters was born and began to 
	flourish.</p>

<p>It is altogether likely that the demolition of the old village hall spelled
	the end of Hans Upp's period of revenge. The reason for his death was now dead
	itself. Perhaps the kindness of the elders in interring his bones made him 
	look upon New Klosters in a favorable light.</p>

<p>But over the centuries, countless numbers of people have been used as 
	foundation sacrifices. The spirit of each one of these unfortunates may yet be
	active today, taking out its anger on anyone it encounters who is in the 
	process of building or frxing something.</p>
