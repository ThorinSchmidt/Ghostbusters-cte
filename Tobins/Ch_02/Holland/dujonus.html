<h4>Dujonus</h4>
	
<p>This spirit is one of the most insidious of all that roam our world. It preys
	on one of man's basic weaknesses - the need to compare favorably with one's 
	peers - and amplifies this minor frailty into a character flaw that ruins 
	families, makes enemies out of friends, and is responsible for a new phrase in
	our language: conspicuous consumption.</p>

<p>Dujonus (only one of thousands of names the spirit has used) can appear as a 
	single person, in the company of a spouse, or even as an average family. It 
	moves into a peaceful neighborhood in the middle of the economic spectrum, 
	makes friends, and then proceeds to drive its neighbors crazy with envy and
	frustration - buyrng this, refurbishing that. It does not act haughty or 
	ostentatious, does not draw attention to itself other than by the fact of what
	it does, what it buys, what it rides in, or what it wears.</p>

<p>Other people see the kind of life it lives, and they decide that's the life 
	they wish to live as well. Just when the victim thinks he's won the game (or 
	at least managed a tie), Dujonus changes the rules. And instead of getting
	irritated at the "person" causing his frustration, the unfortunate imitator 
	redoubles his efforts to keep up appearances.</p>

<p>It is possible to resist Dujonus, but only by strong force of will over a 
	long period of time. If the tempted ever look at his house or his motorcar and
	think, for just an instant, that they would like to have one just as nice, 
	then they have lost. Sooner or later, they attempt to do something or buy 
	something that is beyond their ability to perform or afford, and that is their
	first step down the path to ruin.</p>
