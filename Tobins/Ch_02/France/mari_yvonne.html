<h4>Mari-Yvonne</h4>
	
<p>Her full name was Mari-Yvonne Helary. Her lifelong occupation, her one true
	love, was making linen. She never ventured from her little seacoast cottage in
	southwestern France except to take her linen to market and buy what meager 
	provisions she needed - including more flax fiber for spinning. When she had 
	enough thread, she took it to the village and had it woven into cloth. Then 
	she reclaimed the woven material and finished it.</p>

<p>What distinguished it from the work of other spinners and pressers more than
	any other aspect was its color; or, more accurately, its lack of color. If the
	quality of perfect whiteness can be said to exist, then Mari-Yvonne's linen
	had that quality. Her eyesight must have been inhumanly remarkable, because 
	she rejected even a single fiber of flax if she could see that it would not
	weave or bleach properly.</p>

<p>Many of the women who tried and failed to emulate Mari-Yvonne's linen said 
	(never to her, of course) that Mari-Yvonne's skill was equaled only by her
	obsessiveness; that although she seemed to prefer living alone, she also 
	deserved that kind of life, because she was not a normal woman.</p>

<p>She became ill but continued to work, trimming and finishing the most recent 
	batch of cloth she had brought back from the weaver. When a neighbor 
	discovered her three-days-dead corpse, all of the cloth she had in her 
	possession had been neatly pressed, folded, and stacked in her cupboard.</p>

<p>The neighbor, Lenan Rojou, found Mari-Yvonne's body in bed. She had a rather 
	kindly attitude toward the old woman and was accordingly quite upset to find 
	that Mari-Yvonne breathed no more. But her sorrow was washed away by the flood
	of shock when she opened the cupboard doors.</p>

<p>She rushed home to tell her husband, Goneri, what she had found. Her mention 
	of Mari-Yvonne's death was made almost in passing - the linen was more 
	important, and she implored her husband to come and carry it away for her.</p>

<p>Goneri agreed to do so, but insisted that they leave enough to make a shroud 
	for Mari-Yvonne's body. Lenan saw the merit in this (or so she said at the 
	time) and agreed to sew the shroud while Goneri carted the remainder of the 
	linen back to their cottage. When Goneri returned, he found his wife fondling 
	the swathe of linen he had left behind.</p>

<p>"Why use this beautiful piece of cloth to wrap round a dead body?" she said.
	"Will Mari-Yvonne not sleep just as well in a shroud made of her last 
	bedclothes?" That was all it took for Goneri to be persuaded out of his 
	earlier opinion.</p>

<p>So Mari-Yvonne was laid to rest in a shroud made of her own linen - but linen
	that was wrinkled, soiled and had the scent of death about it.</p>

<p>Two weeks after Mari-Yvonne's body was buried, Lenan and Goneri were found 
	dead in their bed. Each of their faces was frozen in a mask of horror - eyes
	bulging, mouth open, tongue stuck out and distended. They looked as if they 
	had been strangled, but both bodies were unmarked. The Rojous were buried 
	hastily and without ceremony; no one needed to be told that the cause of their
	deaths was quite probably not natural.</p>

<p>Their possessions were put up for auction, as was the custom in the area, but
	no one bought anything. Fven had man and wife died under less sinister - 
	seeming circumstances, no one cared to bid on the enormous stack of linen 
	found in a chest at the foot of the bed - because all of it was stained, 
	frayed, and full of worm-holes.</p>

<p>As so often happens with those who are robbed, swindled, or otherwise treated
	unfairly after their death, the spirit of Mari-Yvonne rose from the grave and 
	will in all likelihood never be satisfied so that it can go to its final rest.
	As is also typical of such cases, the Spirit's purpose is a gross perversion 
	of what the person stood for during her life.</p>

<p>When the spirit of Mari-Yvonne shows itself - a very infrequent occurrence - 
	it appears in the iqage of an emaciated corpse with tatters of dirty white 
	cloth dangling from its body and extremities. From its fingers it spews forth
	a jet of sticky, repulsive-smelling stuff of a putrid green or brown or yellow
	color. The stuff can be cleaned with some difficulty from skin and hair, but 
	any garment or piece of cloth that it touches is irreparably soiled so that it
	must be discarded or burned.</p>

<p>Mari-Yvonne the woman was interested in nothing so much as whiteness and 
	cleanliness; Mari-Yvonne the spirit is obsessed with spreading filth and 
	stench wherever it goes.</p>
