<h2>Spirits of Great Britain and Western Europe</h2><br>

<blockquote>
  <p>Readers of this section who are subjects of the Crown can save themselves
    a bit of time by skipping ouer the following two paragraphs.</p>

  <p>For others, a little explanation is in order. It is all too easy, 
    scientific objectivity notwithstanding, for a researcher into spirits to 
    assume that the legends associated with his native country are somehow 
    more rational, more plausible, and at the same time more interesting than
    the stories handed down among the people of other cultures or countries. 
    If one is not careful this prejudice, no matter how strongly it is 
    suppressed, can creep into the tone of a journal entry as surely and 
    insidiously as the spirits themselves creep into the lives of deserving 
    and undeserving victims.</p>

  <p>With that prepatory note, I acknowledge that the research Shrewsbury
    and I have done into the spirits of Great Britain and Western Europe may be
    unavoidably tainted by our innate British perspective. I assure the reader
    that we will strive to keep all such coloration from our characterizations 
    of others accounts. We will strive... but nonetheless, we will fail.</p>

  <p>Accounts of the appearances of spirits in Western Europe have two 
    significant characteristics in common. They are stories told by simple, 
    unassuming folk - the sort who have no pretensions, no need to falsely 
    impress the listener. And the subjects of these stories follow oft-repeated
    themes - themes that are heard in places hundreds of miles apart and removed
    from one another by years, if not decades. The general conclusions that one
    logically draws from these facts are likewise twofold: One, the stories are
    as real as the sackcloth from which a farmer's wife makes her dress and as
    true as the plain countenances - unembellished by wigs, cosmetics, and 
    other trappings - of the people who tell them. And two, the spirits are very
    active in this part of the world. They hop from person to person the way a
    flea might frolic in a crowd of dogs, and in this fashion can cover a large
    stretch of territory in a very short span of time.</p>

  <p>That observation leads us to a point of speculation: With emigration
    across the Atlantic to the milk-and-honey land of America growing in 
    popularity among Europeans almost by the day, I should not be surprised
    to awaken from the sleep of the grave many decades hence and discover that
    those United States (if they are still, at that point, United) are beset by
    the same hauntings, annoyances, and depredations that have plagued the Old
    Country. Will it still, then, be a Mecca for those who think themselves
    downtrodden or oppressed? Time will tell... as it always does.</p>
