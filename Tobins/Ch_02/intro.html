<blockquote>
<p>Readers of this section who are subjects of the Crown can save themselves
a bit of time by skipping ouer the following two paragraphs.</p>

<p>For others, a little explanation is in order. It is all too easy, 
scientific objectiuity notwithstanding, for a researcher into spirits to 
assume that the legends associated with his native country are somehow 
more rational, more plausible, and at the same time more interesting than
the stories handed down among the people of other cultures or countries. 
If one is not careful this prejudice, no matter how strongly it is 
suppressed, can creep into the tone of a journal entry as surely and 
insidiously as the spirits themselves creep into the lives of deserving 
and undeserving victims.</p>

<p>With that prefatory note, I acknowledge that the research Shrewsbury
and I have done into the spirits of Great Britain and Western Europe may be
unavoidably tainted by our innate British perspective. I assure the reader
that we will strive to keep all such coloration from our characterizations 
of others accounts. We will strive... but nonetheless, we will fail.</p>

<p>Accounts of the appearances of spirits in Western Europe have two 
significant characteristics in common. They are stories told by simple, 
unassurning folk - the sort who have no pretensions, no need to falsely 
impress the listener. And the subjects of these stories follow oft-repeated
themes - themes that are heard in places hundreds of miles apart and removed
from one another by years, if not decades. The general conclusions that one
logically draws from these facts are likewise twofold: One, the stories are
as real as the sackcloth from which a farmer's wife makes her dress and as
true as the plain countenances - unembellished by wigs, cosmetics, and 
other trappings - of the people who tell them. And two, the spirits are very
active in this part of the world. They hop from person to person the way a
flea might frolic in a crowd of dogs, and in this fashion can cover a large
stretch of territory in a very short span of time.</p>

<p>That observation leads us to a point of speculation: With emigration
across the Atlantic to the milk-and-honey land of America growing in 
popularity among Europeans almost by the day, I should not be surprised
to awaken from the sleep of the grave many decades hence and discover that
those United States (if they are still, at that point, United) are beset by
the same hauntings, annoyances, and depredations that have plagued the Old
Country. Will it still, then, be a Mecca for those who think themselves
downtrodden or oppressed? Time will tell... as it always does.</p>
