			<h4>A New Era</h4>

<p>Here we are, only a short time, chronologically (when viewed through the lens of history) from the early 1900s, when J.H. Tobin was pursuing his "research" into the paranormal. Yet we are far from those days technologically and scientifically. Wheras knowledge repositories of the past relied on mass quantities of physical documentation, and dissemination of that knowledge required the inefficient duplication of those mass quantities in multiple locations, the advent of the Information Age has largely freed us of those restraints, allowing near-instantaneous collation of existing data as well as collaboration between individuals on a global scale.</p>

<p>Rather, it would, if only we could convert the physical repositories into modern databases.  This is a task that will likely prove to be neverending.  Converting the sum of Human Knowledge into modern data will take so long, that by the time its accomplished, I am certain our current best will be a distant second to Mankind's future best.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is a task worth doing, lest the knowledge be lost.  The actual <i>usefulness</i> of the knowledge is irrelevant.  Reinventing the wheel, as it were, is something to be avoided.  It doesn't matter that someone recorded their efforts to make a triangular wheel, preserving that information will help prevent someone else from wasting their time.  This, then is where I come in.</p>

<p>Ghostbusters, Inc. now has franchises and branch offices worldwide, and the connectivity of Humanity guarantees that the supersitions and shared delusions of various cultures no longer *stay* confined to those cultures.  Couple that fact with the archaic nature of the "research tools" available, Ghostbusters, Inc. determined that it was vital to their fiscal stability to modernize things, both technologically, and scientifically.</p>

<p>I am not casting aspersions on the abibilities of J.H. Tobin. Indeed, he was extremely well-educated - for his time. Science and research were in their infancy, so it is no surprise that much of this older research needs to be collated with updated information. Tobin himself acknowledged that he was not infallible, and the only real criticism I can find with his work, once the limitations of the era are taken into account, is that he so clearly actually <i>believed</i> in the validity of the so-called supernatual and paranormal.</p>

<p>Thus, in this "Current Edition" of the Spirit Guide, I will not only convert the existing information from the first two  carnations of The Guide - turning it into a modern, searchable database; I will also incorporate the Field Reports and Entity Analysis Forms from Ghostbuster teams worldwide, additionally subjecting all of it to the more rigorous analyses available in the nformation Age.</p>

<p>It is my hope that the astute reader/rearcher will find this a helpful resource.  I shall also be adding my own anecdotes and explanations of more esoteric material in order to also help the no doubt larger audience of Ghostbuster field agents in the aforementioned individual franchises.</p>
