<p style="text-align: center;">_____________________________________________________________</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">A Dream Come True</h3>

<p>You might not believe this, but Spengler says I should write it down anyway. I had a really interesting dream about two months ago. I saw myself from the back, like I was following me around. I was walking along the street when I saw a wrecking crew. They had one of those big iron balls, and they were about to smash this building back into its component parts.</p>

<p>I stopped to watch, and suddenly a-real strong feeling came over me: I had to get inside that building. I rushed up to the foreman and gave him a story about how my grandfather used to live here, and could I look around one last time?</p>

<p>The guy looked at me like I was nuts. I stared him straight in the chest. He held his hand out. I slapped a twenty into it, and he said, "Ten minutes," so I took off for the front door.</p>

<p>Somehow I knew exactly where to go, even though I didn't know what I would find when I got there. I headed for a basement window at the end of a long grimy corridor. One little beam of sunlight was shining through it, hitting the side of a crate. I opened the lid and looked inside, and I got very excited. I couldn't see what I was looking at, because I was behind myself, but I knew it was something good. I grabbed it, ran out of the building, and went skipping down the street. I didn't care about the big iron ball anymore.</p>

</p>And then I woke up. Not the weirdest dream I've ever had, but it ranks right up there. Then two days later I was walking to the drugstore, I turned a corner - and there was one of those cranes with the big iron ball. Everything clicked - and the same feeling came ovei me, there was something in that building I had to get.</p>

<p>Everything happened just the way I had dreamed it. I ran down the corridor, flipped the lid on the crate - and there it was, on top of a stack of dusty, moldy books: J. H. Tobin's Spirit Guide: Being a Compendium of Ghosts, Gods, Spirits, and Manifestations from Outside the Normal Reqlms of Existence, with a Travelogue and Notes on a Philosophy of the Occult Established by the Author. Spengler, Venkman, and I knew that such a book existed, but we had never found a first edition before. The one I gently tucked into my jacket might have been the last one in the world.</p>

Well, we've fixed that problem. Tobin's Spirit Guide is now available again in mass quantities obviously, or you wouldn't be holding it. Actually, this new edition doesn't include every word from the original. Some of the pages were in real bad shape, and quite a few ofthem were just plain missing. Maybe if we find another copy of the book, we'll be able to put out Son of Spirit Guide, or whatever you want to call it. (And if the same pages are missing from both copies, then we've got a different problem altogether.)</p>

<p>About the book: What you have here is a slightly edited and slightly supplemented version of the parts of the original Spirit Guide that we could recover intact. The information on Ectopresence, Power, special abilities and Goals has been added by yours truly (after consultation with Spengler and Venkman; I don't want all the b!ame). In a few places you'll find Editor's Notes, which we put in when we felt that you should be aware of facts about certain spirits that have come to light since 1920. Otherwise, the descriptions of each spirit and the stories that Tobin tells are pretty much the way he wrote them. We even managed to duplicate the original illustrations.</p>

<p>What do we know about John Horace Tobin? Not much, because the guy didn't like to write about himself too often. But from what he did put down, and what other writers have said about him, we can tell you this:</p>

<p>He was born in London in 1870 or thereabouts, the only child of a very well-to-do family. His father made a fortune in business, which made it possible for him to spend much of his recorded life traveling and researching spirit phenomena.</p>

<p>Before he even knew what his life's work would be, Tobin had prepared himself well for it. He was educated at Oxford, where he earned two degrees: one in Obscure Ancient Languages and one in Psychology. Instead of working for his father, which he surely could have done if he had wanted to, he went out to find his own way in the world.</p>

<p>For the last few years of the nineteenth centurv he worked as a record-keeper and middle-management type for a British trading company in Eg:ypt. It was during this time that he got hooked on pyramids and pharaohs and all that stuff - and, as he describes in the Ahagotsu Affair, this eventually led him into exploration of the spirit world. He wasn't the world's frrst Ghostbuster - many other people had investigated paranormal phenomena before him - but he sure was one of the most energetic. From the turn of the century until at least 1920, when his book was published, he spent practically all of his time studying spirits.</p>

<p>Here's a rough reconstruction of where he went during those 20 years:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Late 1899 to 1900-In Egypt, tying up the Ahagotsu Affair; miscellaneous exploration.</li>
	
	<li>1901-02 - Established an office in London, with Shrewsbury Smith as his assistant and collaborator. By placing advertisements in newspapers and otker periodicals in and around London, Tobin was more than moderately successful in getting people to come to him with their stories of contacts with the spirit world. He must have talked to an enormous number of crackpots, and his training in psycholory helped him to separate the flakes from the people who were telling the truth. Tobin made some mistakes (for example, see the introduction to the section on Eastern Europe), but for the most part he was pretty good at reading people.</li>
	
	<li>1903-05 - A series of shorb jaunts into France, Germany, and the Low Countries, sort of an extended working vacation. Shrewsbury Smith went back to London by himself a few times, presumably to clean out the mailbox and renew the lease on the office. Bv the time he finished his book, Tobin could read and write at least four foreign languages (French, German, Dutch, Russian) and could speak a half-dozen others well enough to make himself understood on a simple level.</li>
	
	<li>1905-06 - Another period in the London office.</li>

	<li>1907-11 - A long expedition into Eastern Europ-e and then southward through Turkey into Mesopotamia, because the extremely ancient civilizations of Erypt and the Middle East always were his first love.</li>
	
	<li>1912-13 - More channel-hopping, following up leads uncovered from the mail in the London office. Tobin's timing was lucky, because by the time World War I broke out he had gathered all the information he needed from the Continent. And fortunately for his work, he escaped serving in the British army because he was too old to be drafted.</li>
	
	<li>1914-16 - Back to Egypt, a trip he had been postponing for several years, maybe because he enjoyed the feeling of being able to look forward to it. He and Smith ranged up and down the Nile, from Alexandria to Aswan. They went by ship from Suez to Aseb, at the southernmost edge of the Red Sea. and back again. This excursion ended with a foray north to Damascus and then east to Beirut, where they caught a steamer headed for England. The area they traveled through was occupied by Turkish forces, but since there was no open conflict at the time it was not especially dangerous - at least, no more dangerous than a camelback ride through hundreds of miles of desert is under normal circumstances. Again, Tobin seems to havehad some sixth sense about not getting caught in the wrong place at the wrong time. Just months afber he left the Middle East, British troops descended on Palestine and began driving the Turks back.</li>
	
	<li>1917-18 - Tobin stayed home until the war drew to a close, doing more research and probably composing a lot of the final manuscript of the book.</li>
	
	<li>l9l9 - Immediately after the armistice was signed, Tobin began making plans for a brief trip to the United States, to round out his research. He stayed only two or three months, never venturing far away from the eastern seaboard, and came back to put the finishing touches on the book, which was supposed to have been received by the publisher no later than mid-February of 1920. The fact that he missed his deadline by a couple of weeks does not appear to have caused any Problems.</li>

</ul>

<p>What did Tobin do after the book was finished? That's pretty much a mystery. All we know for sure is that he had no intention of calling it quits. He writes about wanting to make another, much longer trip to the U.S. As air travel became more sophisticated and less risky, he may have decided to head out for more far-flung places - Australia, China, South America. If he did so. he must have traveled alone or with a new companion, because Shrewsbury Smith died in 1924.</p>

<p>For all we know, after Shrewsbury's death John Horace Tobin vanished from the face of the earth. But he was of robust health, and he could easilv have lived another 10 or 15 years. If he did continue his work, which seems almost a certainty, why didn't he publish another book? (Spengler would love an answer to that question. I would love for Spengler to stop asking questions.) The only reason I can come up with is that he died suddenly and unexpectedly, and probably in a place where the people didn't know how important he was. Maybe the notes will turn up someday and maybe in the same way that this book did. Maybe we haven't found them yet because the spirit of John Horace Tobin is still doing research, in a place to which he could never have traveled while he was alive. And if we're really lucky, he'll deliver them personally when he's done.<p>
