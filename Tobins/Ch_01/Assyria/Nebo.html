<h4>Nebo</h4>

<p>I am able to trace this spirit back to its origin - for the simple reason
that I myself have been visited bv Nebo, and I have been able to establish
one vital fact about this supernatural entity that has heretofore been
undiscerned.</p>

<p>Nebo's sphere of influence in the pantheon of Ancient Assyria was 
communication. particularly writing. He has been described in some scholarly
works as the "scribe of the gods." He was quite popular among the Assyrians,
to the extent that he boasted almost as manv followers as his father Marduk,
one of the prime creators in the Assyrian and Babylonian cultures.

<p>It is now clear to me, however, that Nebo never wanted the job his father
foisted upon him, and to this day, hepersists in trying to give it away. Here
I relate, from personal experience, the time that Nebo came into mY life.</p>

Mp>In the waning years of the nineteenth century I was laboring - and that is
trulythe correct word - as a clerk in Alexandria. I enjoyed my location,
since I have always had a particular love.of Egyptian culture and history.
But although I did not fully realize it at the time, i did not enjoy my
occupation.</p>

<p>One day I was nearly asleep at my desk, having been given an especially
dull job on a day when I was not in the best of spirits to legin with. I let
my chin drop toward my chest, and may have actually dozed of for a few 
seconds, when I was shocked back to wakefulness by a man clearing his throat.
Immedi thinking that my supervisor had caught me slacking, I began conjuring
up a suitable excuse even as my head was snapping back to an erect position.
Much to my amazement and confusion, the person I beheld I had never seen
before: a young man of unhappy aspect, dressed in robe and sandals'
holding a pointed stick and carrying a clay tablet. Beforei could speak, he
addressed me: "Do you want to be a serious writer?" he asked.</p>

<p>In fact, I had often envied the authors and scholars whose works I had read,
thinking how wonderfully satisfying it would be to share my thoughts and
findings and have them received by others with tne same sort of enthusiasm 
that I, as a reader, had shown. But at this point in my life, I could not be
sure how to honestly answer this strange person's question. I had an 
instinctive feeling he would not take no for an answer. And so...'Y-yes," I
stammered.

<p>"No goal has ever been abhieved by he who does rot strive for it." the
figure responded, launching into what sounded like a prepared speech/ "If you
wish to emulate me, you must work, not just dream. I am a serious writer by
birthright, but you have no such advantage. You must work". He looked down,
made a mark on his tablet, and said, "I will be back to check on your 
progress."</p>
