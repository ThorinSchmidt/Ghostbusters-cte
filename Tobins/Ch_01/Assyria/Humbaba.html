	<h4>Humbaba</h4>
	
	<p>At some point in mankind's unrecorded past, some nameless individual discovered
		that wood could be used as a building material. This revelation changed the
		course of civilization; neverrnore would man have to content himself with
		huddling in caves or piling up stones to form the walls of an enclosure. Wood 
		was easier to carry than stone, easier to work with, and could be found in gteat
		abundance in places where natural stone shelters were not available.</p>

	<p>But, the world being what it is, very seldom does a good thing occur without a
	negative aspect. To this day, man continues to harvest trees and use the lumber 
	for the good of society - to make houses, ships, packing crates, match sticks. And
	to this day, every time a tree is cut down, the offender risks incurring the 
	terrible wrath of Humbaba.</p>

	<p>This spirit was first named and described in the great Gilgamesh Epic composed
		in ancient Assyria. The Epic stands today as probably the oldest, and one of the
		longest, poems ever written. It treats of many subjects, but here we are 
		concerned with one small section, wherein is described the awakening of Humbaba,
		the great giant who guarded the mountain cedars. The spirit first appeared 
		before a powerful man named Enkidu, who strode into the virgin forest and, with
		one swing of his massive axe, felled a majestic cedar. As big and strong as 
		Enkidu was, he was as a babe compared to the form and power of the entity whose
		attention he had unwittingly attracted.</p>

	<p>As the sound of the tree falling to earth began to reverberate through the 
		forest, it was drowned out by an angry voice: "Who has entered my forest and cut
		down one of my trees?" The voice belonged, of course, to Humbaba. His body, 
		manlike in general form, was as tall as most of the trees in the forest he 
		oversaw. But at the same time, it was the body of more than a man and less than
		a man. He had the paws of a lion at the ends of his arms, the claws of a vulture
		in place of human feet, the horns of a wild bull atop his head, and a snake's 
		head at the end of a massive tail that protruded from his lower back. All the 
		other parts of his body were covered with thick, horny scales, making him both
		invulnerable and immensely powerful. The poem does not relate what became of 
		Enkidu, at least not in any parts of the epic that have been discovered and 
		translated to date. But we do know, from subsequent sightings of Humbaba, that 
		the giant is not especially fast or nimble, and when he attacks he must do so in
		a very careful, deliberate fashion so as not to knock down or damage any trees.
		Thus it is quite possible that Enkidu himself managed to escape the giant's 
		wrath and share his experience with the scribes who set down the text of the 
		Gilgamesh Epic.</p>

	<p>It is apparent that when Humbaba became aware of what had happened to the 
		cedar, he then looked down from his mountaintop abode for the first time and 
		realized that men had been chopping down trees for quite some time. Taking it
		upon	himself to put an end to this depredation, he descended into the realm of
		men and became what we might describe as the world's first conservationist. When
		Humbaba	materializes, his visual form is always preceded by his voice, asking a
		rhetorical question identical with or similar to the one that the giant posed to
		Enkidu. No one whom he catches in the act is immune from punishment, but Humbaba 
		does tend to go easier on those who own up to what they have done. If the 
		offender identifies himself and admits to his mistake, Humbaba reaches out with 
		one of his vulture-clawed feet and snatches away the tool that was used to do 
		the cutting or chopping. His grasp cannot be resisted, and anyone who tries to 
		do eo is fortunate if he comes away from the encounter with only a dislocated
		shoulder. With the axe or saw or wedge or whatever firmly in his talons, Humbaba
		booms, "No more!" and then disappears, taking the implement with him.</p>

	<p>If the offender says nothing (the usual response of someone speechless with 
		terror), denies Humbaba's accusation, or tries to turn and run, Humbaba gets 
		angry. Reports of what he does at this juncture vary widely, suggesting that the
		giant is quite intelligent and capable of employing any tactic that fits the
		situation.</p>
