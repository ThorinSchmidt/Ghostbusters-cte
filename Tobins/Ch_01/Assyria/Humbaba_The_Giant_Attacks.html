	<h4>The Giant Attacks</h4>
	
	<p>A man in the north of France needed the wood from one more small tree to finish
		the roof of a cabin he was building. He went into the glade near his soon-to-be
		new home, from which he had harvested many trees already, and plied his axe one 
		more time. He had trimmed the smaller branches, hitched the trunk to his horse, 
		and was pulling it toward home when Humbaba's voice rang out. The man was 
		petrified when the giant appeared, and could do no more than stand openmouthed 
		and stare. Humbaba, apparently enraged at getting no answer to his question,
		bent down and raked his paws along the sides of the horse, killing the beast 
		instantly. Then he stood, looked off into the distance toward the man's cabin,
		and stooped down again, this time to pick up an enorlnous boulder. With no more 
		than a flick of his wrist, he cast the stone through the air in the direction
		the man had been traveling. Finally, the giant gave out a hideous laugh, took 
		two steps away from the man, and was gone.</p>
		
	<p>When the man got his wits about him once more, he did the only thing he could: 
		trudged back to his cabin, leaving both horse and tree where they lay. All the
		way back, he feared what he would find, and when he arrived after dark he found 
		that his fears had been justified. His carefully constructed cabin was nothing 
		more than a pile of splintered rubble scattered beneath and around a boulder 
		fully twice as tall as he was.</p>

	<p>When travelers came by the next day, they found the disconsolate settler
		sifting	through the debris, tryrng to salvage what he could of his possessions.
		They listened to the man's tale and were gracious enough to give him 
		transportation to the nearest village. Before they continued their journey, they
		suggested to the mayor of the village that the man be watched carefully. It was
		terribly unfortunate, they said, that the man's horse was killed by wolves, and
		worse yet that in his absence a boulder had come loose from a nearby hill and 
		destroyed his cabin - but would it not be better to face the truth of what 
		happened instead of concocting some outlandish story about a horned giant that 
		disembowels horses and tosses boulders through the air?</p>
