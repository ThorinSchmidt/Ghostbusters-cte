<h4>The Wine Seller's Possession</h4>

<p>One day in Baghdad, a man named Seeko Fanta came upon a wine dealer
kneeling before his stall, running his fingers through a large puddle and
humming softly to himself all the while. Everyone else avoided the man,
thinking that he was balmy or besotted. Fanta, a kind and curious man,
approached the merchant and conversed with him.</p>

<p>He tried to get the man to stop by holding his arms, but the merchant
broke free and went back to his task. Then Fanta thought about what the man
said in his speech and hit upon the idea of giving him praise for his work,
so as to humor him.</p>

<p>As Fanta described it in his journal, "I thanked and
praised the man for a short time, but he kept on wallowing in the puddle.
I was about to give up on this approach, because I did not want to be 
carried away to the asylum, too, when suddenly he lifted his head and
thanked me for my kindness. In the next moment his eyes seemed to clear,
and he grinned sheepishly, apologized for the disturbance, and backed into
his tent." The man was the talk of the neighborhood for weeks afterward,
but his business prospered as never before. Everyone who heard about the
incident decided that his wine must be very fine wine indeed.</p>
