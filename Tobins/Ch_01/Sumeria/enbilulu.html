<h4>Enbilulu</h4>

<p>The ancient Sumerians never failed to appreciate the wonderful location
their gods chose for them. The fertile land around the rivers Tigris and
Euphrates made a better territory than the mountains to the north or the
desert to the west. For the boon of living where the weather was pleasant
and crops grew lush and healthy, the people of Sumer gave thanks to the creator-deity Enki and one of Enki's chief assistants, Enbilulu.</p>

<p>Also known as the "canal inspector", Enbilulu's chief responsibility was
the proper functioning of the two rivers. Today, the land around the Tigris
and the Euphrates is still fertile, thousands of years since the Sumerians
passed into history.</p>

</p>But when the Sumerian civilization declined, Enbilulu was deprived of
the homage his worshippers had heaped upon him. The spirit was not heard
from, or very much thought about, for more than 40 centuries.</p>

<p>But the construction of dams, the excavation of farm ponds and
reservoirs, the very march ofprogress - these stirred the water-stirrer
at last.</p>

<p>Enbilulu does his work nowadays by possessing the bodies ofhuman beings
- and these people, when encountered and questioned, are not in the least
reticent about who they are and what they are here to do. The basic speech,
pieced together from accounts related to us by several witnesses to these
possessions, runs something like this:</p>

<p>"I am Enbilulu, who makes the water flow and thereby brings fertility
and life. Water that does not move becomes stagnant and putrid, just as a
person too long in one place stagnates and falls under the sway of the evil
deity Kachpo Tato. People are responsible for themselves, but only I,
Enbilulu, have the duty of seeing that water does not pool or puddle. Now
I have work to do. You will be so gratefuI when you see how good I am!"</p>

<p>Enbilulu's work consists of locating the nearest source of standing
water and setting that water in motion somehow. He continues this activity
for as long as possible - until the puddle evaporates, until the well runs
dry, until the person being possessed falls unconscious from exhaustion. If
the victim is physically restrained, preventing him from doing Enbilulu's
work, the spirit simply leaves the body and goes offin search of another 
helper.</p>

<p>Another way to cause Enbilulu to abandon a possessed body is to give him
the praise he so desperately seeks. A simple "thank you" will not suffice -
he is not that desperate - but if he is lavished with compliments for a 
minute or two, he pauses in his work and says something like, 'You are 
wise to appreciate Enbilulu. Will you be my disciple and take over my work
here?" If the supplicant answers yes, Enbilulu departs the body he is
occupying.</p>

<p>Alter Enbilulu possesses a person, he puts that person to work. Some
tasks are more difficult than others; it's really easy to run from house
to house turning on every faucet, but it's pretty tough to dig a hole in
the dam that's keeping Lake Whatchamacallit from gushing down into Happy
Valley subdivision - and pretty dumb, if that's where your house is.</p>

<p>Enbilulu only likes water when it's moving. A glass of water sitting
still on a table, or water trapped inside a pipe, is a bad thing. Rivers,
wide-open faucets, and fountains are good things. Waterfalls are just 
terrific.</p>
