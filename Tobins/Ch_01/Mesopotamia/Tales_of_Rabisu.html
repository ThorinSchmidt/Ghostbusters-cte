	<h4>Tales of Rabisu</h4>
	
	<p>A student who neglected to prepare his lesson for class told his professor he
		could not study because of a headache "that felt as though it were splitting my
		skull in twain." That night Rabisu crept into his mind silently while he was
		asleep. Its form was that of the student himself - with his skull split open
		from the crown to the bridge of his nose. The vision was so terrifying that the
		student leapt out of bed and rushed to the professor's home in the middle of the
		night to confess his lie. In so doing, he compounded his offense by interrupting
		the professor's liaison with an administrative lady friend; the professor had
		him expelled from school on the spot.</p>

	<p>A woman spoke very kindly of her peers in their presence, but to a third party
		she was quick to point out the faults and flaws in the person's character. One
		day the woman was gossiping when she was suddenly struck speechless. There, 
		standing behind the person to whom she was speaking, was the person she was 
		talking about!</p>

	</p>The image vanished as quickly as it had appeared, but the woman was 
		suficiently unsettled that she changed the subject and began talking about yet
		another "friend." Lo and behold, the image of that person suddenly appeared
		before her view, as though the object of her gossiping had been listening to 
		everything she said.</p>

	<p>The woman was shaken to the core. She excused herself and went home to ponder 
		the meaning of what had happened to her - and from that time onward, she spoke
		her true feelings in front of every person. Human nature being what it is, in a
		very short time she lost all her friends.</p>

	<p>One especially pitiful case involved a precocious babe about three years of age
		who took innocent delight in pulling on the ears and tail of the family dog. The
		animal was docile and quite forgrving, no matter how much pain the boy inflicted
		upon it. The young boy's mother tried and tried to discipline him away from 
		these actions, but the lad persisted.</p>

	<p>One day, the boy's shrills of delight turned to shrieks of terror. His mother
		found him in the corner with his hands over red, pinched looking ears. The 
		child's garbled story accused the sleeping dog of great maliciousness - and to
		this day, that child has never touched a dog again.</p>
