<blockquote>
	<h4>Rabisu</h4>
	
	<p>The ancient Mesopotamians blamed "demons" as the cause of anything bad,
		uncomfortable or unfortunate - accidents, toothaches, quarrels between friends.
		Every demon had a specialty, but with few exceptions the demons were not given
		names.</p>

	<p>One of those exceptions was Rabisu, who was most likely singled out for
		identifrcation because, at one time or another, he visits everyone. This spirit
		appears before a person who has committed some transgression or indiscretion. 
		Rabisu takes a visual form that brings to mind what the person has done, 
		sometimes augmenting and embellishing that image with sounds and illusions, so
		that the victim knows exactly why the visitation is occurring. In all but the
		most hard-hearted of persons, the effect is to leave the viewer overcome with
		anguish and guilt. He or she may deduce, correctly, that the way to get rid of
		Rabisu is to somehow negate or offset the act that caused its visit. In modern
		parlance, this phenomenon is known as easing a guilty conscience.</p>

	<P>On rare occasions Rabisu inadvertently does a good deed, say, in causing a
		robber or a murderer to confess his crime. But in the vast majority of cases
		Rabisu's deeds are far more sinister than those of the people it visits.</p>

	<p>All sane people know the difference between right and wrong, although we 
		sometimes conveniently forget where the line separating them is drawn. The 
		spirit of Rabisu is here to remind us - and to him, there is no such thing as a
		gentle reminder.</p>
