<h4>Caligorant/<h4>

<p>In the earliest days of Egyptian civilization, Caligorant waylaid
travelers. We know that the spirit was originally personified as a
cannibalistic giant who would ensnare voyagers with an enormous net. It is
probable, based on what we have learned from cultures since the days ofthe
pharaohs, that Caligorant is actually an ethereal being, and that the spirit
is not technically cannibalistic or murderous - although its influence can
injuce or kill its victim.</p>

<p>What Caligorant does, in simplest terms, is to cause people to become
lost en route from one place to another. Caligorant can be a thick fog
that conceals the path its victim should have taken. It can be an oasis or
some other sort of illusion that disappears when the traveler reaches the
spot.</p>

<p>There is no way to ward off the spirit if it succeeds in insinuating
itself into a traveler's mind. The best a victim can do is admit to himself
(and to any fellow travelers) that he is lost, and stay in one spot until
help arrives or until the feeling of disorientation and hopelessness passes
(evidence Caligorant has tired of the game and moved on). The worst he can
do is continue to insist that he knows where he's going, for the unhappy
traveler may find his new destination is a place from which there is no
return.</p>

<p>If an illusion of a bogus street sign or a broken - down bridge doesn't
get the victim to change direction, then Caligorant uses control mind to
make him or her think left is right and east is north. If he resists that,
the spirit murphies his compass into giving a wrong reading, or turns the
road map into such a mess that no matter how they fold it, the victim
can never find the section she needs to see.</p>
