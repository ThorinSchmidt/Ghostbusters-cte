<h4>Sphinx</h4>

<p>This is one of the most unusual, familiar, and fearsome creatures of all of those that divide their existence 
	between the physical world and the realm of the ether. We have the ancient Egyptians to thank for statues
	of what the earliest sphinxes looked like, and the somewhat less ancient Greeks to credit for the frrst 
	meaningful glimpse into the sphinx's distinctive personality.</p>
	
<p>Most Egyptian sphinxes had a simple, if bizarre, anatomy: the body of a lion and the head of either a human
	being or of one of the sacred animals (usually a ram, ibis, or bull). When the sphinx had a human head, it was 
	usually meant as a representation of a pharaoh. We know what these sphinxes look like because of the many
	images the Egyptians left behind in wall paintings and sculptures. In every such case, the position and placement
	of the images affirms that sphinxes in Egyptian times were guardians - strong, stolid, and silent. The spiritual
	entities that corresponded to these earthly representations certainly had some kind of consciousness, but no
	anecdotes have survived as to the wit or sensibilities of the sphinx in these early times. All of that changed
	with the rise of the Greek empire, in which these
manifestations from the ether frgured prominently.
A guardian the sphinx still was (and would always
remain)-but now it was a guardian that kept others
on their guard. The sphinx in Greece still had the
body of a lion, to which were affixed the head and
upper body of a human female plus a pair of wings.
As such, it is the embodiment of some of the best
attributes of the animal kingdom: the intellect and "heart" ofhomo sapiens, the physical strength of the
lion, and the ability to fly.
I repeat here two tales which lie at the extremes,
one showing the sphinx capable of doing a deed that
was basically good (except from the tavern keeper's
point of view) and the other demonstrating how
sinister and unfeeling the spirit can be. Perhaps it
has its reasons for everything it does; since it is
apparently impossible to converse with the spirit
aside from the strict question-and-answer dialogue
that it initiates, we may never know any more about
the inscrutable sphinx than we do right now.
In the popular Greek legend, a sphinx guards the
entrance to the city of Thebes-which, not coincir,
