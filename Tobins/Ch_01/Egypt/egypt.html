		<h1>Egypt</h1>
		<p>The land of Egypt has had a long and glorious history. Many, many 
      different peoples have conquered and ruled it over the course of time, and
      thus men ofmany different nations have encountered the spirits of Egypt.
      Some have come under their spells. Some have been seduced	by their powers.
      These may make it possible for the spirits of ancient Egypt to travel to 
      other lands and exercise their powers there. Thus can Sebek appear in the
      streets of Paris.</p>
      
		<p>Thus can the mummy of Ahagotsu haunt the music halls of London. From 
      Europe, who knows where these unearthly things might be able to go: to
      Australia? To Asia? Even to America?</p>
