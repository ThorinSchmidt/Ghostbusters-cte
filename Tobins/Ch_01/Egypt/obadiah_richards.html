<h4>The Tale of Obadiah Richards</h4>

<p>Obadiah Richards, a tavern keeper in the lower class section of 
Manchester, came to his place of business one day to find the door
chained and locked. Also barring his way was a burly woman, the wife
of one of his best customers, who said that she would not unlock the
chains until he could tell her how many mugs of good ale he had sold
in the past month. (As sphinx-questions go, this was quite an easy 
one.)</p>

<p>Every time he guessed a number, the sphinx repeated the question.
He went through every number from one hundred to two thousand, then
threw up his hands in exasperation. In the meantime, the dialogue 
between the man and the woman had attracted quite a crowd, all of whom
were having fun at Obadiah's expense.</p>

<p>One ofthe onlookers shouted, "I never had a single mug o' <i>good</i>
ale in yer place." </p>

<p>Obadiah turned to the woman, swallowed hard,
and said, "The answer is zero."</p>

<p>To the cheers of the audience, the woman unlocked the chains and strode
away. She later professed to know nothing about what she had done, and
many folk thought she had been temporarily possessed. But Obadiah never
forgave her, because from that day on he was forced to lower his prices in 
order to get people to drink his "good ale."</p>
