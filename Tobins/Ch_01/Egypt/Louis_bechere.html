<h4>The Tale of Louis Bechere<h4>

<p>Louis Bechere was a good and kind man who lived outside a small village
in France. He was known for his morning walks through the large briar patch
near his home; he liked to tell people that when he started the day 
surrounded by thorns, nothing he encountered after that could be so bad. 
There was a path twisting across the patch, widening to a fairly large clearing
in the center. Everywhere else the patch was impenetrable. Louis would walk
to the clearing, sit and rest for a few seconds, and then start back out.</p>

<p>One morning he raised his head after his respite and saw before him, 
completely blocking the path, an enorrnous porcupine - a porcupine that
could speak!</p>


<p>The animal said to him, "What is the price of tea in China?" Louis knew
about prices, and he thought he knew what tea was, but "China" was foreign
to him. He panicked and turned to take the other path, but there stood
another porcupine - or perhaps the same one; he could not be sure, since he
could not see in both directions at once. At any rate, it asked the same 
question, and Louis was so befuddled he did not even try to answer. After 
turning this way and that several times and seeing no way out, he lay down
and sobbed himself into exhaustion.</p>

<p>That was how his neighbors found him three days later; when they heard
his story, they became convinced that he had gone quite mad.<p>
