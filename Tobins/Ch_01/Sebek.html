		<h4>Sebek</h4>
		<p>In the summer of 1798, so the story goes, a lieutenant in Napoleon's garrison at Alexandria,
			along with a companion, was strolling down a back street of that fair city when an odd figure
			approached from the opposite direction. The creature was no higher than four feet tall, with a
			stubby human body and a green-scaled head that looked for all the world like the head of a huge
			crocodile.</p>
		<p>"Pardon me," it said, although it had some trouble with the words because a crocodile's mouth
			does not shape the "p" sound easily, "but I require some directions." It then asked the lieutenant
			the way to eighteenth-century Alexandria's most notorious night club.</p>
		<p>A Frenchman true to his nature, the officer replied (here translated): "Sir, you speak French
			abominably. Are you an American?"</p>
		<p>Sebek's strange appearance, strangely enough, doesn't frighten people; they just assume he's wearing
			a mask and trying to get their attention (which is partially true). He wants people to like him, and
			takes large bites out of anyone who makes fun of him or merely pretends to like him.</p>
		<p>He shows up in what he thinks is a popular locale; unfortunately, he's always just a little (at least)
			behind the times. When he's in New York, he looks for a good time at Studio 54; in Texas, he
			wants to ride the mechanical bull at Gilley's; in Small Town U.S.A., he stands on a street corner
			and checks out the girls. Being a nerd, of course, he'll never be really popular— but that won't
			keep him from trying.</p>
