		<h4>Hatshepsut</h4>
		
		<p>Other women before her had been called queen, but (as we Britishers well know) when a king
			and a queen rule at the same time, the latter is always subservient to the former. Hatshepsut
			was the first female to consolidate the power that made a pharaoh a pharaoh, the first woman
			to be recognized (as were all pharaohs) as a deity in the form of a mortal.</p>
		<p>A scene painted on the wall of her temple, damaged but still discernible, shows Hatshepsut in
			what is obviously a warlike stance, opposing a figure with the body of a man and the head of a
			pig. This latter image is thought to be a derogatory rendering of the obscure deity Shovanisti, the
			god of domination.</p>
		<p>One of Hatshepsut's most significant achievements was the reopening of traffic to and from the
			land of Punt, the area of Africa and Arabia bordering the southernmost part ofthe Red Sea, and
			the source of the most fragrant and pungent incense in theworld. (Both of these facts are quite
			relevant in light of the anecdote I will relate.)</p>
		<p>Correlate this with the intelligence that Hatshepsut's tomb was just recently breached, and you can see why we have arrived at our conclusion:
The woman who initiated the drive for equality between the sexes is out to finish the job she started nearly four millennia ago—and I, for one, am not about to suppose that she will not succeed.
