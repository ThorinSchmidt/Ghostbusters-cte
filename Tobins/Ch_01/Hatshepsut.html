		<h4>Hatshepsut</h4>
		
		<p>Other women before her had been called queen, but (as we Britishers well know) when a king
			and a queen rule at the same time, the latter is always subservient to the former. Hatshepsut
			was the first female to consolidate the power that made a pharaoh a pharaoh, the first woman
			to be recognized (as were all pharaohs) as a deity in the form of a mortal.</p>
		<p>A scene painted on the wall of her temple, damaged but still discernible, shows Hatshepsut in
			what is obviously a warlike stance, opposing a figure with the body of a man and the head of a
			pig. This latter image is thought to be a derogatory rendering of the obscure deity Shovanisti, the
			god of domination.</p>
		<p>One of Hatshepsut's most significant achievements was the reopening of traffic to and from the
			land of Punt, the area of Africa and Arabia bordering the southernmost part ofthe Red Sea, and
			the source of the most fragrant and pungent incense in theworld. (Both of these facts are quite
			relevant in light of the anecdote I will relate.)</p>
		<p>Correlate this with the intelligence that Hatshepsut's tomb was just recently breached, and you 
			can see why we have arrived at our conclusion:  The woman who initiated the drive for equality
			between the sexes is out to finish the job she started nearly four millennia ago—and I, for one, 
			am not about to suppose that she will not succeed.</p>
		
		<h5>Questions for a Colleague</h5>
		
		<p>I have not yet had the pleasure of meeting my esteemed colleague Howard Carter. Although both
			of us have spent many years exploring the antiquities along the Nile, our paths have not crossed.
			If they do (perhaps as a result of the publication of this work), I shall be sure to ask two questions
			that have long been preying on my mind.</p>
		<p>It was Dr. Carter who, only a few years ago, led the expedition at Der-el-Bahri that unearthed the
			tomb of Queen Makare Hatshepsut. The record is clear and complete conceming the treasures the 
			tomb yielded, but that is not where my interest lies. I want to know whether Dr. Carter smelled any 
			unusual odor when the tomb was breached. And I want to know if, subsequent to the opening of 
			Hatshepsut's tomb, he noticed a change in his attitude toward the women in our society.</p>
		<p>Strange questions to ask of a renowned Eryptologist? No-not ifone knows the history of the Queen 
			and relates it to our world today.</p>
		<p>I am convinced that Hatshepsut's spirit, after many centuries'repose, is with us again, exerting 
			influence over women (and some men) to bring heretofore unparalleled vitality to the campaign for 
			women's suffrage. Although social reformers have been campaigning for scores of decades, it is only
			now, in the wake of Dr. Carter's discovery, that the movement has become a real force in our culture.</p>
		<p>A man came to us not too long ago, asking for our help in expunging an evil force that had taken over
			his wife's mind. He was quite disappointed that our line of work did not extend to that sort of activity, but
			shared his story with us nonetheless. He and his wife had what he called a perfect relationship, which is
			to say that she provided for all his needs and he was kind enough to keep coming home to her after work
			every night.</p>
		<p>Then one day, a week before he sought us out, she became lackadaisical about her chores, voiced her 
			opinions about things that women weren't to be eoncerned with, and she began an unsettling habit of 
			wrinkling up her nose at him whenever she was in the same room.</p>
		<p>Finally her discontent erupted into outright rebellion. She packed her things and said she could no 
			longer stand to live this way, and further, she simply could not stand the smell of him anymore. She went 
			off to live in a mission sponsored by the Women's Social and Political Union, and has refused to see him 
			ever since.</p>
			
		<p>While Tobin was very definitely a man of his time, a serious student of Victorian English will find many 
			subtle indicators that J. H. Tobin was already a proponent of sexual equality.  Whether that was from
			internal or external motivation, I casnnot definitively say.  Though my opinion is that inequality of genders
			must be learned.  You only need to look at small children at play to understand that.</p>
