		<h4>Mertseger the Silence-Lover</h4>
		
		<p>There are few Egyptian spirits more terrifying than Mertseger the Silence-Lover.
			Patroness of the necropolis (the cemetery; literally, "the city of the dead") of Thebes,
			goddess of libraries and of honest political speeches, Mertseger demands absolute 
			silence from the world around her. She has appeared on this planet several times since
			the fall of the Egyptian civilization, and each time she has been more displeased at
			the tumult and din that marks our modern world.</p>
		<p>From 1551 B.C., Mertseger was worshiped by the grave diggers and caretakers of the
			necropolis near Thebes. She appeared to them sometimes as a woman, sometimes as a giant
			cobra. Thebes was sacked by the Assyrian king Assurnasirpal in 663 B.C. We have very little
			in the way of records for this period, but we do know that Assurnasirpal sent one of his generals
			into the necropolis on a scouting mission. A fragment of the clay tablet that is his report survives.
			Below is a reproduction of the hieroglyphics on that fragment, and a rough translation:</p>
		
		<code>Translation: We went into the necropolis. There were lots ofgraves there. And then we heard
			a noise. SNAKE! BIG SLIMY SNARE!!</code>
			
		<p>There is no record of a sighting of Mertseger after that until the fourth century B.C. Alexander
			the Great had conquered Egypt, founded Alexandria on the Nile delta, and built a tremendous
			library there. Scholars came to the library at Alexandria from around the known world. One of
			these was the Greek chronicler Zippedes of Dougga  . No Greek edition of Zippedes's work
			survives, but in a late Latin translation entitled A Zippede Douggae Ad Zippedem Dei ("From
			Zippedes of Dougga to Zippedes of God"), we read of a friend ofZippedes who returned a book
			late to the library. The librarian "turned into a giant snake and bit the head and shoulders of my
			friend clear off his body, leaving little but a headless, armless corpse oozing blood and venom."</p>
		<p>Modern scholars believe that Zippedes had embellished the story a bit, because no one in fourth
			century Alexandria would buy a book about life in a library unless something interesting occurred
			in it. I disagree. I think that what had clearly happened is that Mertseger had moved north from
			Thebes in the intervening centuries and had settled down in the library. Alexandria was a 
			thriving port in those years. and from there this silent spirit could have sneaked away to any place
			in Europe.</p>
		<p>Mertseger doesn't necessarily intend to kill her victims, just to shut them up. She normally appears
			as a cranky old woman, but can peel away her skin and bones to make herself look like a cobra.
			Her Ectopresence is lowest when she's in a noisy place (a rock concert, the floor of the stock 
			exchange) and highest when she's in a place she really enjoys (a cemetery, the principal's office
			during detention, or the middle of a forest, whether a tree is falling or not).</p>
