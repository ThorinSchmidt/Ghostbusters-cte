			<p>We must begin where man began, in the cradle of ciuilization. Here our 
				ancestors fi,rst set down words for us to read, and here we read of rnan's
				first encounters with unearthly spirits.</p>
			<p>The two great river ciuilizations of the ancient Middle East, those of
				Egypt and of Mesopotamia (Iiterally, "the land between the riuers")
				developed at roughly the same tirne in hurnan history and under somewhat
				the same conditions. They also deueloped adjacent to one another, and thus
				rnay have encountered the sarne spirits.</p>
			<p>I haue spent much of my time and space in this volume on Egypt, as I 
				have a fondness for and an intellectual delight in that culture particularly,
				but ',,:I have taken pains to find room for singularly impressiue
spirits beyond the banks of the Nile. The
M esopotarniane m.pires of Assyr ia and B abylonia are
represented, as well as ancient Sumer, and I haue
gone so far afield as India for a contrast. But let us
start where my heart belangs.
Egypt
The land of Egypt has had a long and glorious
history. Many, many different peoples have conquered
and ruled it over the course of time, and thus
men ofmany different nations have encountered the
spirits of Egypt. Some have come under their spells.
Some have been seduced by their powers. These may
make it possible for the spirits of ancient Erypt to
travelto otherlands andexercise their powers there.
Thus can Sebek appear in the streets ofParis. Thus
can the mummy of Ahagotsu haunt the music halls
of London. From Europe, who knows where these
unearbhly things might be able to go: to Australia?
To Asia? Even to America?
