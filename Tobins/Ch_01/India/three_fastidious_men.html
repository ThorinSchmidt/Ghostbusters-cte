	<h4>Three Fastidious Men</h4>
	
	<p>The tale associated with these spirits comes from India, where 
    fastidiousness and the striving for perfection are a way of life among those
    schooled in the Hindu religion and traditions.</p>

	<p>In the story, the three men are brothers, although this seems to be a 
		convenient contrivance. In their spiritual manifestations, the men do not 
    act as though they are related, and in fact it is almost unheird of for two 
    or more of them to visit a certain person. The spirits are conceited, 
    devious, and each is totally devoled to its purpose-to the exclusion of all
    othei things. They are not	specifically named in anv of the literature 
    concerning them, but to distinguish between them here we shall call them the
    Sensitive One, the Gourmet, and the Hypocrite.</p>

	<p>Each one manifests by controlling the mind of its victim, making that 
    person do, say, and think things that are utterly atypical of the way the 
    person behaves	normally.</p>

	<p>The Sensitive One is on a never-ending quest for perfect physical comfort.
    When this spirit takes over the mind of a victim, that person is frustrated
    by an inability to frnd any chair, bed, or article of clothing that does not
    pinch, sag, or chafe.</p>

	<p>A person polsessed by the Sensitive One does not necessarily offend those 
		around him, but he is certainly seen as a complainer and a nuisance. The 
    victim actually does feel physical discomfort, and for this should be 
    pitied.</p>

	</p>The Gourmet is absolutely particular about food. A person visited by this 
		spirit refuses to eat anything that has not been prepared and presented with
		perfection. Vegetables can be neither overcooked nor undercooked, and they 
    must have been harvested at precisely the moment of optimum ripeness. Bread
    can be neither too doughy nor too dry. In short, it is impossible to satisfy
    the Gourmet. A person controlled by this spirit would rather starve than eat
    something prepared by an anonynous third party.</p>

	<p>The Hypocrite seeks perfection in people - and, people being what they are,
		never frnds it. A man who has believed for years that his wife is beautiful
		suddenly sees her in a new light. Her hair is not perfectly coiffed; she is
		either wearing too much perfume or not enough. The same attitude prevails if
    a wife is afflicted. All of a sudden, her husband is either too flabby or 
    too musclebound; if he is cleanshaven, he should wear a beard, and vice 
    versa.</p>

	<p>The person possessed by the Hypocrite sees himself as the one that everyone
		else should emulate, is quick to come up with a myriad ways in which a 
		particular person fails in that endeavor, and expresses his opinions in no 
		uncertain terms.</p>

	<p>Once a person has been taken over by one of these spirits, it is impossible
    for that individual to force the spirit to leave. As far as the afflicted 
    person knows, he or she is acting quite normally. ("I've never liked the way
    you look, and I've told you that a thousand times before!") When the spirit
    does leave, either of its own volition or because it is compelled to do so, 
    the victim retains-no memory of his personality change and no recollection 
    of any words or actions prompted by the spirit.</p>

	<p>These spirits do not usually stay for long in one person's mind, generally
    leaving after a day or two, or soon after the outbreak of a quarrel or fight
	  directly related to their presence. They can be made to leave much more 
    quickly, if a friend or family member knows just what to do.</p>

	<p>To the Sensitive One, say nothing at all. Do not be apologetic or 
    sympathetic; do not even acknowledge verbally that the victim has made a 
    complaint. But at the same time, make it quite clear that you have heard the
    complaint - you are simply choosing to ignore it. This is the one thing a 
    complainer cannot stand. When the Sensitive One perceives that its moaning
    and groaning are falling on selectively deaf ears, it gives up and looks 
    elsewhere for someone to pay attention to it.</p>

	<p>To the Gourmet, say something like "Eat it anyway - it won't kill you!" As 
    soon as the afflicted person tastes the smallest morsel of the "tainted" 
    food, the spirit flies off in search of another host. In extreme crises, 
    physical restraint and force-feeding may be required, but the result is the
    same as if only verbal coercion had been necessary.</p>

	<p>To the Hypocrite, respond not with a pained look and quiet indignation, but 
		with the most vitriolic and well-deserved insults you can muster: "So I'm 
		unappealing, eh? Well, when I stand next to you, I sometimes wonder what 
    kind of dead animal you're keeping inside your shirt, because nothing alive
    couid smell that bad!" In other words, pretend that you are possessed by the
    same spirit. If the victim is more shocked and more insulted than you were,
    then you have done the job properly. The Hypocrite will go away, looking for
    easier prey.</p>
