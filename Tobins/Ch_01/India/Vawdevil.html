<h4>Captain's Log - The Vawdevil</h4>
<ul>
  <li>"May 4: High spot of the journey so far. As per my instructions to 
    first mate, the crew gathered for an extemporaneous celebration of
    my birthday. Speech by bosun's mate was short but touching, calling
    me 'best cap'n we've ever sailed under.' Mood slightly spoiled when
    one man in back of group snickered at that statement. Six suspects
    flogged simultaneously; three of them confessed." Capt. Esau Skowlin</li><br>
  <li>"May 16: Journey still bedeviled by unseemly mirth and levity among
    the crew when my back is turned, Have ordered prayers recited two 
    hours after the end of each watch to stem the frivolity, but giggling
    continues. Have threatened to revive the stocks." Capt. Skowlin</li><br>
  <li>"June 12: The limit of my tolerance has been reached. Let them 
    cackle. No longer will I suffer loss of dignity - and, in truth, I 
    can ill afford to lose any more crew. So let them laugh, because I 
    will not be listening. Time to end this entry now; ship's surgeon has
    just arrived to puncture my eardrums. Those fools think they've got 
    the best of me, but they'll soon see who's in control here." Capt.
    Skowlin</li><br>
  <li>"July the 17th: All survivors overjoyed at making port; 'tis good
    to be home. Have sent to Bedlam for a carriage for the poor Captain, 
    and have turned the Vawdevil over to the Portsmouth Harbourmaster for
    disposal. God willing, she'll put to sea in better spirits next time."
    First Mate and Acting Capt. Drew Grinsom</li><br>
