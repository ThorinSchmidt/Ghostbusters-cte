<h4>Siliman</h4>

<p>"Laugh, and the world laughs with you," writes poet Ella Wheeler Wilcox.
A century before she penned that line, Friedrich von Schiller observed that
"The joke loses everything when the joker laughs hirnself." Those two bits
of philosophy opposed as bits of philosophy often are - illustrate the range
of mortal reaction to the irrepressible sprite known as Siliman.</p>

<p>The spirit is believed to have originated in India, possibly as the result
of the Black Hole of Calcutta tragedy. Records indicate that one of those that
perished on the night of June 20th, 1756 was Johannes Siljermann, a jovial
Dutch merchant. The survivors tell that Siljermann tried, even to the last, to
cheer his fellow prisoners in their cramped, subterranean cell, telling puns
and riddles and repeating bawdy rhyrnes. The similarity of moniker and the 
description of this brave man's personality leads me to conjecture that it is 
his spirit that travels the ether, trying to bring good cheer and laughter to 
the darkest moments of mankind.</p>

<p>Certainly, not all men and women respond to laughter in the same way. Many 
folk find themselves joining in with a merry chuckle even if the conversation
is not their own - when they hear laughter, they cannot help but laugh 
themselves. On the other extreme, some few individuals of grim mien find mirth
beneath their dignity in even the most informal situations. It is this
indifferent response that seems to goad the spirit into inducing laughter 
without care for the consequences - and results in those infrequent sorry 
tales we have recorded in Siliman's name.</p>

<p>Siliman was not easily discouraged (a trait, it must be noted, that is 
shared by every would-be humorist this writer knows of), but even the spirit's
irrepressibility had its limits, and the Indian continent cannot have been the
most comfortable place for a spirit of mirth and humor. It is virtually 
certain that Siliman left India in April of 1875, bound for Portsmouth aboard
the H.M.S. Vawdeuil. Siliman must have been greatly gratifred at the reception
it got aboard the Vawdeuil,notwithstanding the fact that the crew comprised a
captive audience. Buoyed by its newfound success, the spirit went merrily on 
its way and found the Western world to be truly a land of opportunity.</p>
