	<h4>An Encounter with Nasnas</h4>
	
	<p>A well-to-do matron was intermpted by Nasnas while getting dressed for an
		evening at the theatre. She had just picked up one of a pair of enormously
		valuable earrings. When she saw the spirit, she screamed and fainted dead away.
		In doing so, she must have dropped the earring on the floor or otherwise caused
		it to be separated from its companion, which was still in her jewelry box amid
		many other baubles.</p>

	<p>When she regained consciousness after what must have been only a minute or so,
	she was relieved to see that the Nasnas had vanished. But her shock at what she
	had seen was nothing compared to the emotional trauma she suffered when she
	discovered that the earring she had been holding had mysteriously disappeared. The
	woman did not go to the police - who would believe a story of a one-armed, one-
	legged jewel thief? - but did come forth in response to one of my many
	advertisements soliciting tales of unexplained occurrences.</p>
