    <h1>Yemen (Hadhrmaut)</h1>
    
    <p>Tobin had little to say about this ancient civilization. Possibly because 
      little was known, or because he simply wrote about what he liked. Either 
      reason is plausible, and frankly, it's not really something that needs to
      be defended. In an effort for completeness, however, here are a few facts
      about Hadhramaut, or as the area is known today: Yemen.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Hadhramaut ... is a region in South Arabia, comprising eastern Yemen, 
        parts of western Oman and southern Saudi Arabia. The name is of ancient 
        origin, and is retained in the name of the Yemeni Governorate of 
        Hadhramaut. The people of Hadhramaut are called Hadarem. They formerly 
        spoke Hadramautic, an old South Arabian language, but they now 
        predominantly speak Hadhrami Arabic, which has much influence from 
        Hadramautic.</p>
      
      <h3>Ancient History</h3>
      
      <p>The Hadhrami are referred to as Chatramotitai in ancient Greek texts.
        Hadhramautic texts come later than Sabaean ones, and some Sabaean texts
        from Hadhramaut are known. Greek, Latin, Sabaean and Hadhramautic texts
        preserve the names of a large number of kings of Hadhramaut, but there
        is as yet no definitive chronology of their reigns. Their capital was
        Shabwa in the northwest corner of the kingdom, along the Incense Route.
        Eratosthenes called it a metropolis. It was an important cult centre as
        well. At first the religion was South Arabian polytheism, distinguished
        by the worship of the Babylonian moon god Sin. By the sixth century the
        monotheistic cult of Raḥmān was followed in the local temple.</p>

      <p>The political history of Hadhramaut is not easy to piece together. 
        Numerous wars involving Hadhramaut are referenced in Sabaean texts. From
        their own inscriptions, the Hadhrami are known to have fortified Libna 
        (modern-day Qalat) against Himyar and to have fortified Mwyt (Ḥiṣn 
        al-Ghurāb) against the Aksumites in the period following the death of 
        Dhū Nuwās (525/7). The kingdom ceased to exist by the end of the third 
        century AD, having been annexed by the Himyarite Kingdom. Hadhramaut 
        continued to be used in the full titulature of the kings of Sabaʾ and
        Dhu Raydān (Himyar).</p>

      <p>Early Islamic authors believed the nomadic Kinda tribe that founded a
        kingdom in central Arabia were originally from Hadhramaut, although 
        distinct from the settled Hadhrami population.</p>

      <p>Miqdad ibn Aswad al-Bahrani, a companion of the Islamic prophet 
      Muhammad, was reportedly from Hadhramaut. A number of prophets before them
      are believed to have dwelt here, including Houd of ʿAad. He is thought to
      be buried at Qabr Hud, which is also called Shiʿb Hud, but this is not 
      universally accepted.</p>
