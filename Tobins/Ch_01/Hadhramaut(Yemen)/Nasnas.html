	<h4>Nasnas</h4>

	<p>Tales of this monster-spirit originated in the exotic land of 
		Hadhramaut[*], at the extreme end of the Arabian peninsula. Those of us in the
		Western world were forewarned of its existence by an esteemed countryman of mine
		Edward William Lane, who devoted much of his life to the study of Oriental 
		legends and spirit phenomena.</p>

	<p>In tlre first volume of The Arabian Nights' Entertainments, Lane gives a 
		description of the creature which is at the same time straightforward and subtly
		terrifying. It is, he says, "half a human being; having half a head, half a 
		body, one arm, and one leg, with which it hops with much agility."</p>

	<p>The monster is capable of speech, but it has never been known by observers in
		the Western world to utter more than a single syllable. Perhaps this is because
		it has only half a mouth; however, the theory I have developed postulates that
		what it says is directly related to the purpose it is trying to achieve through
		its visitations.</p>

	<p>I submit that at one time, the creature had a whole body, a whole head, a full
		face, and that through some supernatural calamity it was cleaved in two. Nasnas
		is, technically, the name the entity went by before it was divided and turned
		into a monstrosity. Now it prowls (more properly, hops hither and yon) through 
		the world of men, cryrng over and over again, "Nas! Nas! Nas!" The poor 
		creature, you see, is searching for its other half. By itself, it is Nas. Only
		when it finds the other Nas will it be reunited as Nasnas and then be able to 
		return in peace to the realm whence it came. (For the sake of conformity with
		prior usage - and in recognition of the fact that this theory is, after all,
		only a theory - I will continue to use the full name in reference to the half - 
		creature which is described herein.)</p>

	<p>Where its other half is, and whether the monster can rejoin into a whole 
		creature after finding it, are questions we cannot answer. It would be good for
		us mortals, and for Nasnas itself, if there were some way of putting the 
		creature out of its misery, but we have neither the technology nor the 
		methodology to attempt such a task.</p>

	<p>Inside its half-brain, Nasnas seems to have some sort of warped empathy for
		objects that have suffered a fate similar to its own - things that have been cut
		in half, or one ofa pair of items that has been separated from its mate. If
		Nasnas spies such an object during one of its visitations, the creature touches
		or snatches up the thing, apparently intending to take it along and seaich for 
		the object's missing half as well as the rest of its own body. The affected 
		object disappears, never to be seen again... at least, not in this world.</p>
