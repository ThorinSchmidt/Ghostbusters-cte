	<h4>Shamash</h4>
	
	<p>The Babylonian sun-deity Shamash was revered for centuries. He brought the
		light every morning the light without which there could have been no life. He
		was not an evil-minded spirit when he was first called upon to do his work, but
		even spirits have their flaws. In Shamash's case, his biggest flaw was a self-
		importance as huge as the sky he was credited with illuminating.</p>

	<p>If the truth be told - and it certainly was not told to the people of that 
		long-gone culture - all Shamash did all day was lounge (probably in some sort 
		of ethereal hammock). He did nothing to contradict the people's assumption that 
		he was responsible for the movement of the sun across the sky - which was 
		probably all for the best, because the Babylonians of 17OO B.C. were neither 
		intellectually or psychologically ready for the realization that it was the sun
		that stayed in one place and the earth that did the moving.</p>

	<p>It was for the preservation and strengthening of his own self-image that he did
		not protest when the Babylonians also deemed him responsible for the healing of
		disease, the dispensing of justice, and the protection of the downtrodden and 
		underprivileged. It seemed to make the people happy to think that there was one
		spirit who could do so many good things - and Shamash, basking in the glow of
		all this unwarranted adulation, had quite a pleasant existence for many 
		centuries.</p>

	<p>Then, as must happen to every civilization made up of mortals, the ancient 
		Babylonian culture declined and was supplanted. When it passed from the scene,
		Shamash too fell into decline. But he did not disappear; he simply bided his 
		time in his celestial lounging spot, waiting for the day when another group of 
		people would single him out for praise. That plan began to unravel in the 
		mid-sixteenth century, when Nicholaus Copernicus had the brilliance (and the 
		audacity, from Shamash's point of view) to propose that the celestial bodies
		were configured differently from what men had believed since the dawn of 
		civilization. It took some time, but eventually people around the world, 
		scholars and common folk alike, came to see that the sun, not the earth, was the
		center of the solar system.</p>

	<p>Shamash was furious when he realized that never again would he ascend to a 
		position of prominence. So he decided to come to earth and manifest himself in a
		way that would force people to pay attention to him whether they wanted to or
		not.</p>

	<p>Because he was originally and primarily associated with the sun, Shamash
		made light and heat his areas of specialty. Because he is annoyed with modern
		people for accepting the truth of the Copernican Theory, he is determined to
		make a nuisance of himself in as many ways as he can imagine. Shamash is the 
		sliver of light that slips under the door of a photographic darkroom and 
		destroys images made on film. Shamash is the unseen force that causes lamps and
		lanterns to be lit in a room that is unoccupied. Shamash is the wave of heat 
		that sweeps over a person for no apparent reason, causing him or her to feel 
		faint or ill. Shamash is the gust of warmth that inexplicably causes an icebox
		to fail, so that the food kept inside it spoils and rots.</p>

	<p>If you have ever witnessed or heard of a strange and unfortunate occurrence
		concerning light or heat or both, the chances are good that Shamash had 
		something to do with it. Shamash never appears visually, except as some form of
		pure light - a soft glow, a sharp beam, or whatever suits his purpose.</p>

	<p>He cannot be detained by any rnethod or device known to us, for he moves with
		the speed of light. He may stay in one location for quite some time, such as
		when he appears in the night sky as a floating ball of light and allows himself
		to be viewed by dozens or hundreds of bewildered onlookers. Or he may leave 
		someone's presence as quickly as he arrived, stayirng only long enough to 
		terrify his victim with a sudden burst of light or a wave of heat that first 
		causes the person to perspire uncontrollably and then, with its passing, to curl
		up in a ball and shiver with cold. Truly Shamash is one of the most elusive, 
		versatile, and devious spirits that has ever haunted our world!</p>
