    <h1>Babylon</h1>
    
    <p>Typically, Shrewsbury says little of Babylon. Here is a short excerpt
      from History.com about the common knowledge of Babylon:</p>
      
    <blockquote>
    
      <h2>Where was Babylon?</h2>
      
      <p>The city of Babylon was located about 50 miles south of Baghdad along
        the Euphrates River in present-day Iraq. It was founded around 2300 B.C.
        by the ancient Akkadian-speaking people of southern Mesopotamia.</p>

      <p>Babylon became a major military power under Amorite king Hammurabi, who
        ruled from 1792 to 1750 B.C. After Hammurabi conquered neighboring city-
        states, he brought much of southern and central Mesopotamia under 
        unified Babylonian rule, creating an empire called Babylonia.</p>
      
      <h2>Tower of Babel</h2>
      
      <p>The city of Babylon appears in both Hebrew and Christian scriptures. 
        Christian scriptures portray Babylon as a wicked city. Hebrew scriptures
        tell the story of the Babylonian exile, portraying Nebuchadnezzar as a 
        captor.</p>
        
      <p>Famous accounts of Babylon in the Bible include the story of the Tower
        of Babel. According to the Old Testament story, humans tried to build a
        tower to reach the heavens. When God saw this, he destroyed the tower 
        and scattered mankind across the Earth, making them speak many languages
        so they could no longer understand each other.</p>
        
      <p>Some scholars believe the legendary Tower of Babel may have been 
        inspired by a real-life ziggurat temple built to honor Marduk, the 
        patron god of Babylon.</p>

    <p>And now, some information you will not find in mainstream history:</p>
    
    <p>Babylon, like Sumeria, was founded by people of Mesopotamia, which makes
      Babylon a "sibling" of that ancient dawn civilization.  Therefore,
      many of Babylon's ancient powers and spirits were "shared" with Sumer,
      as both civilizations inherited them from Mesopotamia.</p>
      
    <p>As Babylon grew, it gave rise to its own set of gods, spirits, and magical 
      traditions which were slowly spread to the rest of the world through the 
      expansion of the Babylonian Empire under Hammurabi, and later through the
      Neo-Babylonian Empire under a new succession of kings, such as 
      Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
