		<h1 id="intro"><a href="#tableofcontent">Introduction</a></h1>
		<p style="margin-left:25px;">The field of Ghostbusting has undergone much 
		development. Especially in the analysis and classification of the supernatural. What follows is a
		condensed “cheatsheet” if you will, of the current standard classifiers and descriptors used by 
		professionals to more easily and concisely share critical information about the various entities we 
		encounter. This quick, standardized classification system comes in handy during tense confrontations
		or supernatural disasters.</p>
		
		<h1 id="classification"><a href="#tableofcontent">Classification:</a></h1>
		<p style="margin-left:25px;">Originally developed by Dr.s Spengler and Stanz,
		this system has remained virtually unchanged from the early days of paranormal investigation. Most of
		the changes have been in the nature of supplemental information. Here then are the 7 classes and a
		thumbnail description for each.</p>
		
		<h3 id="class1" style="margin-left:25px;"><a href="#tableofcontent">Class I:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">These are undeveloped forms, insubstantial and
		difficult to see. Interaction with the environment is limited and enigmatic (e.g., spetcral lights, voices
		and sounds, non-corporeal vapors, etc.). Simple application of a proton pack beam is normally
		effective.</p>
		
		<h3 id="class2" style="margin-left:25px;"><a href="#tableofcontent">Class II:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Manifestations focused in this time and space, Class II
		ghosts and up can corporeally manipulate things in this world. These forms are vague, inconsistent, or
		incomplete (e.g., floating sheets, ghostly hands, animated lips, etcs.). Although a normal proton pack beam 
		is normally effective, some Class II ghosts have the capacity to return attacks.</p>
		
		<h3 id="class3" style="margin-left:25px;"><a href="#tableofcontent">Class III:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Anonymous Hauntings. Distinct human form and
		personality is evident, but former identity (i.e., as a living being) is not established. If established, the ghost is
		reassigned as Class IV. Often difficult to deal with, Class III ghosts generally possess sophisticated means of 
		defense.</p>
		
		<h3 id="class4" style="margin-left:25px;"><a href="#tableofcontent">Class IV:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Identity established; distinct human form and personality
		with known identity, such as General Custer or Cleopatra, Economic disposal methods include research in the
		background of said entity, as well as possible communication with it.</p>
		
		<h3 id="class5" style="margin-left:25px;"><a href="#tableofcontent">Class V:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">These are non-corporeal manifestations of definite but
		non-human form. Speculation includes the theory that Class V’s are formed from emotionally-charged events
		or as side effects of ritual summonings. (The spud Peter Venkman talks about so much was a by-product of the
		rituals that a cult held in the Sedgewick basement.) These typically require extensive proton pack implementation
		to eradicate</p>
		
		<h3 id="class6" style="margin-left:25px;"><a href="#tableofcontent">Class VI:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Ghosts from lower life forms. A giant penguin was once 
		seen attacking a mugger in Central Park. Later it was discovered the penguin was a ghost. Unique solutions are
		often required to handle these entities, including research into habitats, allergies, natural enemies, etc.</p>
		
		<h3 id="class7" style="margin-left:25px;"><a href="#tableofcontent">Class VII:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Metaspetcres. Obsessively malevolent, exceptionally
		powerful, and exhibiting control over subordinate forms, such entities are potentially very dangerous. These are
		often  identified by primitive cultures as “Demons”. Entities which fit this classification include Gozer 
		and Zuul. Neutralizing them is usually a problematic undertaking at best. Most standard procedures are futile.
		The most realistic plan is to take measures to prevent these things from entering this sphere of influence in the
		first place.</p>
		
		<h1 id="description"><a href="#tableofcontent">Description:</a></h1>
		<p style="margin-left:25px;">These tags give a description of the entity’s standard “M-O”.
		While each ghost will be different, they generally tend to fall into one of about 6 categories:</p>
		
		<h3 id="freefloating" style="margin-left:25px;">
			<a href="#tableofcontent">Free Floating(Travelling):</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">This creature is not tied to any place or object, roaming at
		will. While it may become attached sentimentally to a person, place, or object, such things have no power to 
		compel or control the entity.</p>
		
		<h3 id="anchored" style="margin-left:25px;"><a href="#tableofcontent">Anchored:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">An Anchored creature is tied to a particular thing, and
		cannot move very far away from it, normally. Usually the anchor is an objetc of some kind, but can also be a 
		person, animal, or even a place.  Regardless, the anchor is what keeps the entity around. Removing the 
		anchor will, in the case of an non-corporeal manifestation, cause it to disperse. In the case of a corporeal
		manifestation, removing the anchor will cause it to either die, disintegrate, explode, or possibly just revert back
		to what it was originally.</p>
		
		<h3 id="semianchored" style="margin-left:25px;"><a href="#tableofcontent">Semi-Anchored:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Like an Anchored entity, this one is also tied to some sort of 
		focusing artifact. However, removing the anchor will not banish/destroy the entity. It will merely weaken it,
		making it possible to eliminate the entity with more traditional means: i.e. Proton Packs and Slime Blowers.
		The difference between this and fully anchored creatures is sometimes subtle, and so care should be taken 
		when dealing with them, since eliminating the anchor may render the creature impotent, but re-creating the anchor
		will restore it completely.</p>
		
		<h3 id="inhabiting" style="margin-left:25px;"><a href="#tableofcontent">Inhabiting:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">This type of spook is your traditional “haunted house” ghost.
		They are confined to a specific area. Usually a house or other old structure, but can occasionally inhabit cars,
		mobile homes, or even (in at least one case) a Porta-Potty. Often, these resemble Anchored and Semi-Anchored
		creatures, so careful investigation is needed to determine the difference, since inhabiting ghosts can be removed 
		by normal means, but Anchored entities cannot, while the anchor exists. </p>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Try to ascertain if anything significant happened when the 
		ghost manifested. Was it after old Uncle Jimmy died and now he haunts his boyhood home? Is the client 
		complaining that his newly-purchased vintage Porsche 550 is handling strangely, but the mechanics can’t find 
		anything wrong? Or work on it more than once?</p>
		
		<h3 id="repeating" style="margin-left:25px;"><a href="#tableofcontent">Repeating:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">This type of ghost is tied not to a specific place, but a 
		specific time. While it may still manifest in the same location(s), or haunt the same person(s), it does so on a
		definite schedule. . Alternatively, the entity may appear randomly, but will always do the exact same thing during
		each manifestation, such as walking down a hall, or jumping from a bridge, or jogging through a park.</p>
		
		<h3 id="caustic" style="margin-left:25px;"><a href="#tableofcontent">Caustic:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">This type of creature does harm to the corporeal Plane just
		by existing, and making contact. Ghosts or monsters that drip acid, or are on fire, or even emit toxic gas. All
		would be considered Caustic. corporeal contact with these entities is NOT
		 recommended!</p>
		
		<h1 id="characteristic"><a href="#tableofcontent">Characteristic</a></h1>
		<p style="margin-left:25px;">This category gives a one-word description of how the
		entity interacts with the surrounding environment. This can give valuable insight into how to proceed with a
		confrontation as well as how well it is likely to go.</p>
		
		<h3 id="benevolent" style="margin-left:25px;"><a href="#tableofcontent">Benevolent:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Benevolent spirits are just that; kind, helpful, solicitous
		of needs  Like the ghost of a nurse in a children’s ward who continues to quiet fears, and dispel 
		nightmares. Or perhaps a classic example like Santa Claus. Such beings don’t need to be “busted” per se, but
		they should be noted and at least watched. </p>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">What if, or example, the children’s ward is shut down, or
		the hospital closed? What then would that ghostly nurse do in order to find someone to “care for”? Or what if
		Santa should decide every child deserved a pony for Christmas? Again? Benevolent doesn’t mean “safe to
		ignore.”</p>
		
		<h3 id="harmless" style="margin-left:25px;"><a href="#tableofcontent">Harmless:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">This type of ghost might also not warrant busting, as its
		effects are not dangerous. The ghostly growl, or the bar patron described in the Remnant section would be
		examples of Harmless. Cold spots, or faint odors would fit as well. </p>
		
		<h3 id="annoying" style="margin-left:25px;"><a href="#tableofcontent">Annoying:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">The Annoying category is where serious attention may be
		warranted. This level includes simple poltergeist activity such as knocking things over, or causing harm of a
		non-fatal nature; burns, bumps, bruises, or minor cuts.</p>
		
		<h3 id="disruptive" style="margin-left:25px;"><a href="#tableofcontent">Disruptive:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">This category often overlaps with Annoying. But unlike the
		random activity of an Annoying ghost, a Disruptive one seeks to thwart the success of whatever is happening. 
		This sort of behavior is often seen in ghosts seeking Revenge. Like causing meals to putrefy on the table in a
		restaurant, or power failures at a rock concert.. Also unlike Annoying ghosts, Disruptive ghosts have no problem
		with killing people if it feels that will help its goal. This type of activity usually starts small, and escalates over
		time, so early identification is crucial.</p>
		
		<h3 id="malevolent" style="margin-left:25px;"><a href="#tableofcontent">Malevolent:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">This type of creature is concerned with doing as much
		damage to as many as possible. Killing is not the primary goal here. The main focus is spreading as much 
		suffering as possible, among as many as possible. The type of suffering could be
		physical, mental, or emotional. However, killing is often a side effect of these entities.</p>
		
		<h3 id="deadly" style="margin-left:25px;"><a href="#tableofcontent">Deadly:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">The only real difference between Malevolent and Deadly
		ghosts is purpose. Deadly ghosts want as many people to die as possible. Their methods can vary, but the end
		result is the same: massive numbers of dead bodies.</p>
		
		<h1 id='type'><a href="#tableofcontent">Type:</a></h1>
		<p style="margin-left:25px;">This fourth classification provides general insight into wha
		t a Ghostbuster can expect. If an animator, an Investigator knows to keep an eye out for objects attacking from
		the rear.  If a possessor, everyone knows to monitor for changes in teammate behavior.</p>
		
		<h3 id="possessor" style="margin-left:25px;"><a href="#tableofcontent">Possessor:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">A Possessor is most happy when it is, of course, 
		possessing someone or something. The most common vessels for these ghosts are
		humans. But they can also possess other animals, machines, other objects, and in rare cases, other ghosts. A 
		vessel is chosen based on its suitability for the entity’s current purpose. So often a human is chosen when the
		ghost wants to interact with the corporeal world, and an object when they wish to go “dormant” for a 
		time.</p>
		
		<h3 id="remnant" style="margin-left:25px;"><a href="#tableofcontent">Remnant:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">A remnant, as the name implies, is a remainder or a piece of
		a once living being. While it could be argued that this applies to any ghost, a remnant is a fragmentary remainder,
		often one-dimensional in character. For instance, the growl of a deceased beloved family pet that is heard when
		certain people enter the house, or perhaps the  spectral form of a former bar patron that appears in his 
		favorite barstool whenever a full beer is placed on the bar there, but does nothing else. These would be classified
		as remnants. </p>
		
		<h3 id="swarm" style="margin-left:25px;"><a href="#tableofcontent">Swarm:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">A swarm is a cohesive group that acts in concert. This could
		be a herd of ghostly bison, or flock of birds or even a hive of ordinary bees with a hyper-intelligent hive mind.
		The key here is that they must be dealt with as a group. Individual losses will not greatly affect it.</p>
		
		<h3 id="animator" style="margin-left:25px;"><a href="#tableofcontent">Animator:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">An animator is similar superficially to a possessor, except that
		it causes inanimate items to act according to its wishes. Animators tend to focus on objects rather than people,
		since objects have no will to be able to resist commands. Articulated machines are a favorite since they have
		natural appendages, but things like tables can be used, and even things like lamps and vases can be animated in a
		pinch. A favorite tactic of animators is to attack from an unwatched direction, so try to stay in groups.</p>
		
		<h3 id="conduit" style="margin-left:25px;"><a href="#tableofcontent">Conduit:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Conduits are methods of connecting two “places” that do not
		normally connect. This could be to another plane of existence, or to the deli around the corner. They can take many
		forms; ancient stone doorways to nowhere, the traditional mirror, or even, in one case, a shower stall that sent
		people to the women’s restroom at the St. Louis Greyhound Station whenever someone flushed the	toilet.</p>
		
		<h3 id="vapor" style="margin-left:25px;"><a href="#tableofcontent">Vapor:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">Vapor is kind of the “catch-all” or miscellaneous category.
		The others all tend to be “one-trick ponies”, but a Vapor doesn’t really fit any other category. In many ways
		these ghosts are more dangerous, since they are capable of anything, and sometimes everything. A vapor isn’t
		going to “just” be an animator. It might also be a possessor, or also a Swarm. Vapors are the most unpredictable
		kind; from ghost to ghost and moment to moment.</p>
		
		<h1 id="manifestation"><a href="#tableofcontent">Manifestation:</a></h1>
		<p style="margin-left:25px;">A somewhat simple but important aspect of analysis is
		whether the entity manifests as either a corporeal or non-corporeal creature. This mostly is due to the fact that
		different methods of combat and capture are used for each type:</p>
		
		<h3 id="ectoplasmic" style="margin-left:25px;">
			<a href="#tableofcontent">Ectoplasmic or Physical:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">An Ectoplasmic entity is what most people associate with 
		ghosts. They are non-corporeal, and largely vulnerable to Proton-based weapons. They can be trapped with a
		Ghost Trap and put into a Containment Grid.</p>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">A physical entity is, of course, corporeal. Common examples
		are: Zombies, Vampires, and werewolves. Many times corporeal manifestations are immune to Proton-based
		weapons, so things like Slime Blowers, or wooden stakes are preferable. These creatures cannot be Trapped like
		non-corporeals.</p>
		
		<h3 id="mindless" style="margin-left:25px;">
			<a href="#tableofcontent">Mindless or Intelligent:</a></h3>
		<p style="margin-left:50px;">A mindless entity operates purely on instinct. It has no real plan, and no concept
		of long-term goals. Some specimens can exhibit short-term cunning, such as evading obstacles, or choosing the
		weakest opponent.</p><p style="margin-left:50px;">An intelligent entity, however, is quite capable of
		long-term planning, can often communicate, and can sometimes be reasoned with.</p>
		
		<h1 id="specialabilities"><a href="#tableofcontent">Special Abilities:</a></h1>
		<p style="margin-left:25px;">This last section is not really a defining category. It is a list of
		details observed in a particular ghost or other creature. The powers and abilities are wide, and not fully explored 
		or understood. There are, however, some common abilities that have been observed. However, the particulars of
		how that power manifests is highly variable, almost unique to each creature. While both a Sandman and a
		Night Mare can both induce sleep, they do it very differently. In fact, the very nature of the type of sleep is
		drastically different. One bringing pleasant rest, and the other fitful, restless, energy-draining slumber.</p>
		<p style="margin-left:25px;">Abilities are further categorized as Greater or Lesser. The designations
		are mostly one of scale. And some Abilities actually exist in both categories, as they manifest in different 
		ways.</p>
		<p style="margin-left:25px;">An additional word about these
		powers. Many of them stem from the earliest days of Ghostbusting, and were named officially by Dr. Venkman,
		and despite the protests of Drs. Spengler and Stantz, they stuck.</p>
