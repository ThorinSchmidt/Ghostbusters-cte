<h4>The Restless People</h4>
	
<p>As with many types of spirits, these denizens of the otherworld are known by
	many epithets. The one we choose here, probably coined by Sir Walter Scott in 
	the early nineteenth century, seems to typify the behavior and motivation of
	these most troublesome entities. Individually, these spirits are often 
	referred to as elves, fairies, fawns, sprites, and other terms of that ilk. 
	Minor differences seem to exist between the types, but it has become apparent
	that drawing such fine distinctions is not only pointless, but frustratingly 
	futile.</p>

<p>Let the hair-splitters debate whether elves are more mischievous than 
	sprites, whether fairies are more cheerful than fawns. As far as we can 
	ascertain - and the body of information on this topic is extensive and deep -
	each one of the Restless People is capable of anything that any of the others
	can do. In this respect, they are similar to the species of man: while 
	Orientals are different from Caucasians, Hispanics different from Negroes, we
	are all of us human beings, and the traits that make us men do not differ from
	race to race.</p>

<p>Just as we have a civilization and a culture, so it has been theorized that 
	the Restless People live in a world of their own, with rules and mores that we
	cannot comprehend, let alone appreciate. They get married and they procreate 
	(though it has been suggested, not always in that order). They grow old, and 
	they die, although death for them must be something entirely different from 
	our earthly definition of it. Is it possible for a spirit to expire and thus
	give birth to the spirit of a spirit? A question beyond the scope of this 
	work, and indeed beyond the ken of present-day research techniques - although 
	logic tells us that we cannot dismiss the possibility.</p>

<p>If the Restless People have a culture, a society with structure and meaning, 
	it follows that they have professions and careers - things they do to take up
	their time, to give purpose to their existence. If this is true, then their 
	professions must all involve being some kind of a nuisance to man and his 
	world, because that is the only activity that any of the Restless People seem
	to indulge in.</p>

<p>For no reason save its own unfathomable ones, an elf might decide to appear 
	before a man, levitate him 1O feet in the air, spin him head over heels a few
	times, and leave him hanging upside down from a tree branch. A favorite trick
	of the fairies is to cause the milk of a cow to dry up - a frustration for the
	farmer, to say nothing of what the cow's reaction might be.</p>

<p>One of the Restless People's meaner and more unsettling pranks is to cause an
	invisible wound in or on a victim's body, producing a sharp pain that can be 
	quite a physical and psychological jolt to the unsuspecting person. Some 
	researchers, seeking to attach a "logical" explanation to an illogical act,
	suggest that these wounds are precipitated by tiny, invisible elf arrows that
	(so the theory continues) can be fired across an infinite distance with 
	unerring accuracy. Of course, no one has ever recovered one of these arrow-
	heads - but then again, lack of evidence has never been a hindrance to 
	speculation.</p>

<p>Perhaps the mystique about arrow-heads derives in part from the fact that 
	most encounters with the Restless People take place in the out ofdoors, and
	particularly in or near woodlands - which is the sort of territory an archer,
	human or otherwise, is likely to frequent. Another fact fits neatly into this 
	line of, reasoning, that being that the fairy-folk favor dressing in the color
	green, which would afford them excellent camouflage in the forest. However, no
	one has satisfactorily addressed the question of why the spirits need to 
	camouflage themselves against discovery by humans, since they can render 
	themselves invisible to us whenever thev want.</p>

<p>By taking note of the day of the week on which victims have been assailed by 
	the mischief of the Restless People, it has long been established that elves 
	and their ilk are most active, and especially malicious, on a Friday. Those 
	who seek to attach religious significance to this fact point out that this is 
	the day on which the Crucifixion occurred, and thus the day on which "evil" 
	spirits are liable to flourish, but there is no hard evidence that would 
	warrant making this connection. And in any event, the Restless People are not 
	"evil" in the extreme sense of the word. They are far from harmless, to be 
	sure, and they are not without their cruel aspects, but there is nothing in 
	all our knowledge of them that indicates they have ever deliberately caused
	the death or the mortal injury of a human being. Secondary effects are another
	matter, though; we have heard of several incidents wherein a poor man or woman
	died or was grievously injured as a consequence of events following an 
	encounter with an elf.</p>

<p>The Restless Folk do not read minds, so they do not know (and, it must be 
	pointed out, do not care) when they are about to plague someone with a fragile
	disposition or a weak heart. We submit, based on numerous case studies, that 
	anyone with an abject fear of heights refrain from going for a stroll through 
	a forest. The companions of one George Bowman say they will never forget what
	happened to poor George one day when they were all walking through a small 
	wooded area south of Horsham in Sussex. In the blink of an eye, George was 
	invisibly hoisted off his feet, carried some 20 feet into the air, and 
	suspended there, prone and face down so that he could see the ground beneath
	him. Even had he been dropped from such a height, the fall would not have 
	killed him - but the thought of falling was enough to do him in. His friends 
	relate how George's face took on an expression of utter terror. He shook his 
	head violently from side to side, but was apparently otherwise unable to move.
	Then the head-shaking stopped - and when George's inert body floated back down
	to the ground a moment later, the man was dead.</p>

<p>The other travelers had a bit of trouble explaining all of this to the 
	authorities, but in the end they were not charged with any wrongdoing. 
	George's body had not a mark on it, so it was patently clear that he had not 
	come to any physical harm - at least, not of the sort that one man can deliver
	upon another. The case remains offrcially unsolved - but one might suppose 
	that if the investigating constable ever finds himself 20 feet in the air with
	no visible means of support, the book on George Bowman will be closed as soon 
	as the officer comes back down to earth.</p>

<p>We have no reason to believe that the unseen entity or entities that lifted 
	George into the air intended for him to die as a result of the experience. No
	one save for George's closest friends knew that he was terribly afraid of 
	falling (an aflliction that he apparently acquired when, as a baby, his 
	grandmother dropped him on his head), and not even George could have known that
	the prospect of taking a tumble would be sufficient to cause him a fatal 
	seizure.</p>

<p>Why was George victimized and not the others? First, it is not uncommon for 
	the Restless People to perpetrate their pranks in front of witnesses; they 
	seem to take a perverse pride in doing what they do, and no doubt they have 
	themselves quite a chuckle at the thought of how both the witnesses and the
	victim will explain what happened. Hearkening back to what was said earlier 
	about the arrow-heads (and forgetting for the moment my reservations about 
	that theory), it is conceivable that George was singled out because of his 
	surname - which might be good reason for caution if your name is Archer or if
	you are a man called Marks. The final point that bears upon this last question
	is a fact that does not appear in the official record, but which came out
	during our interview with one of the witnesses. On the fateful day, George 
	Bowman was proudly decked out in a new jacket - of bright green - while
	everyone else in the party was attired in outer garments of more subdued 
	tones. Make of all that what you will, Dear Reader. You are free to draw your 
	own conclusions, and you need not be swayed by any judgments that you find 
	herein. But if you elect to consider George Bowman's death a matter of mere
	coincidence, then please do not bother asking me to go for a walk in the woods
	with you.</p>
