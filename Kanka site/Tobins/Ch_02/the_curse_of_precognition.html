<h4>The Curse of Precognition</h4>
	
<p>No one paid attention when, in 1437, a Scottish woman (whose name, not 
	surprisingly, is lost in antiquity) prophesied that King James I was going to
	be murdered. She said she got the information from a spirit named "Hudhart," a
	statement which certainly did not help her credibility.</p>

<p>Perhaps she would have been believed if she had claimed to know about the 
	plot because she was involved in it - but then she surely would have been 
	summarily executed, which is a rather high price to pay for giving a truthful
	prediction.</p>
	
<p>Anottrer tale demonstrates the fate that has typically befallen those who are
	visited by the soothsaying spirit. A simple and honorable woman by the name of
	Bessie Dunlop, residing in Ayrshire in the year 1576, suddenly began to evince
	an ability to locate lost items, and to foresee what the resuli of an illness
	would be. When questioned about how she came to have such knowledge, she 
	replied that the facts were put to her by a spirit that identified itself as
	Thome Reid.</p>

<p>She professed to have no training in medicine, yet on several occasions was 
	able to identify the nature of an illness and even concoct poultices and 
	herbal remedies to help afllicted people or livestock recover from their 
	ailments. For these and other services she rendered, she steadfastly gave 
	credit where credit was due, telling all who cared to know that in fact the
	spirit Thome Reid was responsible for these betterments, and she merely served
	as the earthly conduit through which the ghost's knowledge was passed.</p>

<p>Bessie Dunlop was good-hearted, soft-spoken, and modest. But none of that 
	seemed to make any difference to the village elders. On November 8, 15?6, she
	was officially accused of sorcery and witchcraft. The trial (if it could be 
	called that) took place promptly. As for the outcome of the proceedings, the 
	last three words of the official record speak for themselves: "Convict and 
	burnt."</p>

<p>But not all of Hudkin's visits cause tragedy to its auditors. Consider Maggie
	Pyle, proprietress of The Swan, a posting house in Dover. Her native 
	politeness, while it did not stop the crime she was warned of, at least spared
	herself from harm. In her own words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I was shuttin'the place up after the last Mail Coach 'ad gone, 'cause 
	business is allus poor to none after that hour, when in walks this dandy
	looking gent. I wouldna thought nothin' of it, but I couldna remember 'im 
	openin' the door. Of a sudden, 'e was just there.</p>

<p>"I ast 'im if 'e be needin' a room - silly question, but y'got to say 
	somethin'."</p>

<p>" 'Thank you for asking' says 'e, and 'is voice is almost 'ollow,'but no. I
	am here to be of service to you. I am here to tell you that, unless you take
	steps to prevent it, a dog and his master will die one week from tonight in 
	the room at the top of the stairs.'</p>

<p>" 'E said that real calm-like, as if 'e knew just what 'e was talkin' about.
	Well, I knew about loonies - my Jack, bless'is soul, 'ad a sister that took a
	fevdr and wasn't right in 'er 'ead after. Sweet as butter, but not all there,
	she wasn't. And I allus treated 'er nice, so I thought I owes 'im the same. 
	I'm just as glad 'e's not wantin' a room. So I says thank you for lettin' me
	know, but now I got t'get back to work."</p>

<p>" 'Of course you do,' 'e says. 'I am glad I could be of service.' I turned 
	around for a second or two, makin' like I was busy with somethin' so's 'e'd 
	get the idea - and when I turned back to say g'night to 'im, 'e was gone. Now
	that was strange; it's a good five paces from the desk to th' door, and I 
	didn't hear the door open an'close."</p>

<p>"Well, to make short work of it, I come 'round t' believing I 'ad a dream of
	'im, and forgot the whole of it. I don't truck with no flibberty-flabberty, 
	usual. I'm a sensible widow.</p>

</p>"But then - oh, it chills me just to tell it - a week later, t' the exact
	night, in walks a constable. 'Is partner and 'im be trackin' a man as escaped
	from th' work farm, an' the trail leads right to my door.</p>

<p>"I tell 'im to check the rooms - what else could I do? - an' before I can say
	'cricket' the partner an' a bloodhound as baggy-faced as y' please come in an'
	a'tearin' up the stairs. Of a sudden the dream comes back t' me, but I'm too
	feared t' call out. If they do run inta trouble, I says t' myself, I don't 
	want it bein' on account of my hollerin' down th' house."</p>

<p>"So I heard th' whole awful thing. The first room they try, a'course, the dog
	snifllin' and snuffin' while th' partner knocks, it be th'one. 'Im as is in it
	shoots straight through the door an' takes the partner in the stomach. There's
	a thud, an'the door smashes in - an'the hound be howling... Oh, mercy,'e shot
	th'dog, too."</p>

<p>"I was never so sorry, not e'en when my Jack took 'flu an' died. I swore if 
	the gent came baek t' me, I'd listen good nex' time, but 'e never stopped in
	agin. An' I never told a soul about all this till jus' now. Ain't th' world a
	strange place?"</p>
