    <blockquote>
    
      <p>... One of the fundamental English characteristics is diversity within
        a small compass. No place in England is more than 75 miles (120 km) from
        the sea, and even the farthest points in the country are no more than a
        day’s journey by road or rail from London. Formed of the union of small
        Celtic and Anglo-Saxon kingdoms during the early medieval period, 
        England has long comprised several distinct regions, each different in
        dialect, economy, religion, and disposition; indeed, even today many 
        English people identify themselves by the regions or shires from which
        they come - e.g., Yorkshire, the West Country, the Midlands - and retain
        strong ties to those regions even if they live elsewhere. Yet 
        commonalities are more important than these differences, many of which
        began to disappear in the era after World War II, especially with the 
        transformation of England from a rural into a highly urbanized society.
        The country’s island location has been of critical importance to the 
        development of the English character, which fosters the seemingly 
        contradictory qualities of candour and reserve along with conformity and
        eccentricity and which values social harmony and, as is true of many 
        island countries, the good manners that ensure orderly relations in a 
        densely populated landscape.</p>

      The history of England is rich with variety, and rich with relationships 
      with the Unseen. Even its close neighbors - Scotland, Irelan d and Wales -
      share in this. Were the waves of invasions and incursions purely of mortal
      design? Were there perhaps outside spirits coveting what the local ones
      had? It is something to keep in mind when researching England.  More than
      anywhere else, even the United States, most spirits are not native.</p>
