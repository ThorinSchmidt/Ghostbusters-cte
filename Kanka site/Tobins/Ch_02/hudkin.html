<h4>Hudkin</h4>
	
<p>Ever since early homo sapiens became aware of the concept of "tomorrow," man
	has been preoccupied with the future. Everyone wonders what tomorrow,or next
	week, or next year, will bring, and everyone thinks it would be wonderful to
	know what is going to happen before it occurs - everyone that is, except for 
	those few unfortunates who actually have been vested with the power of 
	precognition.</p>

<p>This spirit goes by many names, and frequently does not identify itself at 
	all. We use here one of the names by which it was known in medieval Germany
	and Holland. In England and Scotland during the same era, the spirit of 
	precognition often introduced itself by the friendly-sounding name of Robin
	Goodfellow. Nowadays it seems to prefer being called by whatever name (if any)
	a person elects to attach to it.</p>

<p>By studying the many documented accounts of soothsayers in history, we can 
	presume several facts about how Hudkin functions and what the spirit's 
	motivation is. Its pronouncements are not always specific or laden with 
	detail, but they are unfailingly true; thus, it is apparent that Hudkin 
	travels through time as easily as a bird flies through the air. The spirit is
	somehow able to move into the future, observe a happening, return to the 
	present, and convey its information to whichever human it has chosen to 
	associate with.</p>

<p>Hudkin is not a hostile spirit; it does not attempt to mislead or deceive,
	and it does not couch its statements in riddles. Why, then, is the spirit 
	loathed by most of those whom it has visited?</p>

<p>The answer lies not in the nature of the spirit, but in the nature of man.
	The world is full of fraudulent soothsayers - people who proclaim themselves
	able to see into the future, but have all the visionary ability of a sack of 
	oats. They have given true diviners a bad name. With pitifully few exceptions,
	true visionaries have been ignored, ridiculed, sometimes even punished and, in
	the extreme, killed.</p>

<p>Historically, according to the accounts we have read about and have heard, 
	Hudkin seems to prefer visiting itself upon females. Those of you who would
	scoff at the concept of women's intuition would be well advised to reconsider
	that viewpoint. Perhaps there is a good reason why women have a reputation for
	being able to foretell. Perhaps they are more inclined, physiologically or 
	psychologically (or both), to take Hudkin's revelations for truth, and thus 
	over the centuries the spirit has developed an affinity for those of the 
	female gender.</p>

<p>This affinity, obviously, is not without its drawbacks. Many women, in return
	for making public the revelations that Hudkin has granted them, for trying to 
	help others by telling what they know, have been regarded as witches. Others,
	in more recent times, have been politely but disdainfully scorned - because,
	after all, they are "only women."</p>

<p>If you are visited by Hudkin and you do not want to be laughed at, shunned,
	thrown in jail, or worse, then the only thing to do is keep quiet. In the
	words ofan earlier researcher on this subject: "Hudkin is a very familiar 
	spirit, who will do nobody hurt, except he receive injury, but he cannot 
	abide that, nor yet be mocked." In other words, the thing to do is not resist,
	not argue, not question. Appear to be receptive while the spirit is in your 
	presence.</p>

<p>There are right ways and wrong ways to go about this keeping quiet. Do not,
	for instance, acknowledge and address the spirit by saying something like "Oh,
	you're that Hudkin character that Professor Tobin told me to ignore." All that
	will do is get both of us in trouble. Hudkin is not normally malicious, but 
	the spirit does have a lot of pride - and if you injure that pride by 
	consciously, outwardly disregarding the spirit and what it has to say, then 
	you risk bringing down its not inconsiderable wrath.</p>

<p>Listen to what it has to say, be properly grateful for the information - and
	then, when the spirit has left, erase the entire incident from your memory.
