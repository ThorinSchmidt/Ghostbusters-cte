<h4>An Addendum by the Author's Friend</h4>

<p>Smith here - Shrewsbury Smith, that is... at your service. And I do indeed 
	have a great service to perform with regard to the monster known as 
	Nuckelavee.</p>

<p>When my colleague Tobin entrusted me to deliver the finished manuscript of 
	this book safely to the publisher, he had no doubt that I would perform the 
	task unfailingly. What he could not have known is the fact which I now relate 
	to you - and to him, when he browses this entry at some time subsequent to 
	printing and binding: I have added some words of my own to what he set down 
	about this monster.</p>

<p>I am convinced that I have discovered a way to thwart Nuckelavee, and I 
	cannot in good conscience let Tobin's essay on this creature be printed before
	amending it with the following paragraph.</p>

<p>Nuckelavee can be satisfied by giving it skin. It doesn't have to be your own
	skin, although in a pinch this will suffice. You can give it the peelings of a
	potato, the rind of a lemon, a shoe or a leather jacket - any sort of skin 
	will do. The monster doesn't care to wear the skin, only to keep it from being
	worn by someone or something else. I imagine that the creature thinks that if 
	it has to go through eternity without skin, then all other things should be 
	skinless as well.</p>

<p>There - now I've done it, for better or worse. Tobin may never forgive me for
	going behind his back, especially as I have taken advantage of the opportunity
	he unwittingly afforded me to set down a theory (although I consider it more 
	than that) with which he vehemently disagrees. If it turns out that I am 
	right, and the information I have just imparted saves only one person from the
	horror of Nuckelavee, then the loss of my friendship with John will have been 
	a small price to pay.</p>
