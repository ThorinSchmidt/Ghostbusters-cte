<blockquote>
  <p>Samhain is a powerful and thoroughly malevolent
spirit, rumored to be the purest manifestation of
the evils associated with All Hallow's Eve, or Halloween
in the United States. The spirit of legend is
a goblin lord of incredible po\Mer, able and quite
willing to wreak havoc and spread misery on a truly
horrific scale during the few hours each year when it
manifests itself in our earthly realm.
It is widely agreed that Samhain can only appear
from sunset onAll Hallow's Eve, October 31st on the
modern calendar, to sunrise on All Hallow's Day,
November lst. No records we know of ever reported
an encounter with the goblin at any other time' For
this, at least, we can be thankful.
Folklore from the early Middle Ages suggest that
Samhain may have had an existence as a Celtic
god-and before that, a similar entity appears in
pictographs dating as far back as ancient Phoenicia.
Both Celtic and Phoenician spirits were known to
cause mischief and grief in their night abroad, and
both were held at bay by fire.
In Celtic times the custom became that a family
left sweets on the porch for the goblin and its followers
to appease their appetites. Then the frightened
folk removed a safe distance and huddled'round a
bonfire all the night through, stoking the flames so
that the spirits could not approach'</p>
