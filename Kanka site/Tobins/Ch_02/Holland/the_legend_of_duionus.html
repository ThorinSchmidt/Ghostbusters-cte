<h4>The Legend of Dujonis</h4>
	
<p>A long time ago, so it is told, there came to the city of Amsterdam a man who
	called himself Jacob Dujonus. He purchased a modest home and quickly 
	established himself as a popular member of the neighborhood.</p>

<p>He took much pride in the appearance of his property: hedges always trimmed, 
	flagstones always swept, fresh paint and fresh mortar continually applied 
	whenever the old began to fade or crack. All of his effort did not go 
	unnoticed, of course, and homeowners in the vicinity felt behooved to follow 
	his lead in keeping their own tracts better maintained (so that their 
	dwellings would not look run-down by comparison with his).</p>

<p>Then Jacob started to improve his property and expand his possessions. He
	built an entranceway outside his front door, so that visitors would not stand
	in the rain while waiting for him to answer the door. He had larger windows 
	installed. so that the interior of his home was well illuminated even on 
	cloudy days. He came home one day in a fancy carriage - the first person in 
	the neighborhood to own any vehicle other than a small cart or a ramshackle
	wagon.</p>

<p>His neighbors did not take this lying down. In some houses, wives badgered 
	their husbands for entranceways and larger windows; in others, husbands 
	convinced their wives that instead of food and clothing, what they really
	needed was a new carriage just like Jacob's.</p>

<p>In one way or another, every other householder in the neighborhood tried to 
	duplicate some or all of what Jacob was doing. No matter what Jacob did, his
	neighbors tried to emulate him, and as soon as they succeeded Jacob would go
	one step further. Families began living beyond their means in order to present
	a good appearance, and one by one they fell into bankruptcy and were forced to
	move to less expensive housing.</p>

<p>A year after Jacob moved into the neighborhood, his was the only house out of
	dozens that still remained occupied; all the others were vacant and in various
	stages of disrepair. The day after his last neighbor moved away, Jacob rode 
	off in his carriage and never returned.</p>

<p>Only after it was too late did the homeowners realize the futility of trying
	to keep up with Dujonus. To this day, throughout the civilized world, people 
	are still learning this lesson the hard wav.</p>
