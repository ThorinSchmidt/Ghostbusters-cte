  <p>One day, so the tale goes, Death was bested in a battle with a mighty giant
    and left weakened and suffering by the side of the road. A young man passed 
    by the spot soon afterward and restored Death to full vigor with a draught
    from his flask.</p>
    
  <p>Death, being as grateful as Death can be, revealed its identity to the man
    and made him a promise: "I spare no one, and can make no exception with 
    thee; but that thou mayst see that I am grateful, I promise thee that I will
    not fall on thee unexpectedly, but will send my messengers to thee before I
    take thee away."</p>
  
  <p>The man expected nothing for his help, and so was quite happy to receive
    this boon. He went away and lived the rest of his life knowing that he never
    needed to fear that an illness or injury would be fatal, so long as Death's
    Messengers did not appear before him. He grew old and suffered many bouts of
    sickness and other maladies, but recovered and was looking forward to an 
    even longer life.</p>
  
  <p>Then one day Death tapped him on the shoulder and told him that his time 
    had come. The man was confused and felt betrayed. He argued that he should
    not die, because Death had not kept its promise.</p>
  
  <p>"Have I not sent one messenger to thee after another?" Death replied. "Did
    not fever come and smite thee, and shake thee, and cast thee down? Has 
    dizziness not bewildered thy head? Has not gout twitched thee in all thy 
    limbs? Did not thine ears sing? Did not toothache bite into thy cheeks? Was
    it not dark before thine eyes? And besides all that, has not my own brother
    Sleep reminded thee every night of me? Didst thou not lie by night as if 
    thou wert already dead?"</p>
  
  <p>To all of that, the man was speechless - not that any protests would have 
    made a difference. He accepted his fate, and Death led him away.</p>
