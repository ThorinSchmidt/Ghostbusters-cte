<blockquote>
  <p><i>Grimm's Household Tales</i> is a delightful and interesting book, full
    of tales that run the gamut from fanciful to frightening, from frivolous to
    factual. One of the most frightening stories in the volume, and one which is
    also arguably taken from fact, concerns the spiritual phenomena known 
    collectively as Death's Messengers.</p>
    
  <p>Medical science supporbs the study of folklore and antiquities on this 
    signifrcant point: Death most often does not come unannounced or unforeseen,
    so long as someone knows what signs to look for. One other fact is 
    irrefutable: no matter how many times its messengers are repelled or 
    ignored, Death can only be postponed. It can never be prevented.</p>
    
  <p>In practically every culture in which the entity is personified, Death is
    portrayed - quite correctly, it would seem - as impartial and uncaring. It
    can, and does, take infants as well as octogenarians. It can strike down a 
    healthy person with shocking suddenness, or it can take someone who has lain
    ill and abed for years, someone for whom death might actually be a blessing.
    </p>

  <p>And therein lies the key to understanding how Death's Messengers choose to
    conduct themselves. In addition to the physical maladies they cause 
    directly, the messengers savor every opportunity they can get to torment a 
    victim with fear and anxiety. Their most favorite targets are those people 
    who know them for what they are, the people who are sure that a stabbing 
    pain or an episode of delirium is a sign that Death is on its way. In fact,
    Death may not choose to take a person so afflicted for many months or years 
    - but in the meantime, Death's Messengers will have a sadistically jolly 
    time torturing that person over and over again. A sliver of anxiety and 
    apprehension becomes a crack, then a crevice, then a chasm as the messenger
    makes repeated visits and its poor victim becomes more and more morose, 
    pessimistic, and withdrawn.</p>
    
  <p>The messengers are Pain, Dizziness, Delirium, Discomfort, Numbness, and 
    Torpor. They may visit a victim singly or in any combination, except that 
    Pain and Torpor do not usually consort together, because one tends to offset
    the effect of the other but when they do visit at the same time, the 
    cumulative effect can be more torturous than the most vicious punishment 
    that one man can inflict upon another: imagine, if you can, feeling 
    excruciating pain while being unconscious and helpless to do anything to 
    alleviate it.</p>
  
  <p>The messengers are usually invisible. Delirium is never visible, but its 
    presence serves as a catalyst for any or all of the other messengers to show
    themselves if they so desire. It attacks the sensory mechanisms and the 
    brain directly, causing the victim to see or hear or smell things that don't
    really exist except in his mind.</p>
  
  <p>Pain takes whatever visual form most closely corresponds to the kind of 
    hurt the victim is suffering: a ball of flame for a burning sensation, a 
    bloody dagger or knife for a stabbing pain, a body being crushed by an 
    enormous weight to simulate a dull and persistent ache.</p>
  
  <p>Dizziness is an amorphous form that swirls and pulses sickeningly, making
    the viewer disoriented and nauseous. Discomfort may appear as large weights
    tied to the victim's wrists. If the subject is instead afllicted with 
    buzzing in the ears, discomfort resembles a grotesque bumblebee that 
    constantly hovers along-side his head and cannot be swatted or shooed away.
    </p>
  
  <p>Numbness can be a terrifying sight. If it causes a victim to lose the 
    feeling in his foot, for instance, then it appears as an empty space 
    separating the foot from the rest of the body. If it affects a victim's
    entire body, a condition known as paralysis, then the victim perceives that
    the very air around him has turned solid and murky, making independent 
    movement impossible. The victim can be lifted and moved by someone else, but
    cannot initiate such actions.</p>
  
  <p>Torpor manifests as a faceless, floating figure covered in a black shroud.
    As it moves closer, the blackness envelops the victim and brings with it 
    unconsciousness. This messenger, because of its form and its effect on a 
    victim, is often mistaken for Death itself.</p>
  
  <p>If you have ever suffered a pain that no medicine would alleviate, don't 
    blame your physician. If your hand has ever "fallen asleep" for no apparent
    reason, now you know what the reason might be. If you have ever been 
    overcome by a feeling that something about the world around you is suddenly
    and horribly unreal, don't look for a rational explanation. Admit to 
    yourself, and be mindful of the fact, that you have been visited by Death's
    Messengers. They may be trying to tell you that your demise is imminent, but
    it is just as likely that they are more interested in tormenting you... so
    that when Death does come for you, you will welcome, rather than dread, its
    arrival.</p>

<h3>Retold From Grimm</h3>

<h3><i>The Malevolent Six</i></h3>

<p>Not every one of the Messengers has all of the special abilities listed 
  below, but most of them have most of them, if you know what we mean (or even
  if you don't). For instance, Torpor doesn't have <i>creature feature</i>; it 
  only <i>matelializes</i> in one specific form. Delirium doesn't 
  <i>materialize</i>, but (as Prof. Tobin figured out) the other Messengers only
  become visible after Delirium is already present. When a Messenger visits a 
  victim, it takes pleasure in causing pain, dizziness, or whatever. But the 
  bottom line goal of every Messenger is to make the victim mortally afraid that
  he's about to die. Of all the spirits that are capable of scaring someone to 
  death, these guys are the experts.</p>
