  <p><i>Grimm's Household Tales</i> is a delightful and interesting book, full
    of tales that run the gamut from fanciful to frightening, from frivolous to
    factual. One of the most frightening stories in the volume, and one which is
    also arguably taken from fact, concerns the spiritual phenomena known 
    collectively as Death's Messengers.</p>
    
  <p>Medical science supporbs the study of folklore and antiquities on this 
    signifrcant point: Death most often does not come unannounced or unforeseen,
    so long as someone knows what signs to look for. One other fact is 
    irrefutable: no matter how many times its messengers are repelled or 
    ignored, Death can only be postponed. It can never be prevented.</p>
    
  <p>In practically every culture in which the entity is personified, Death is
    portrayed - quite correctly, it would seem - as impartial and uncaring. It
    can, and does, take infants as well as octogenarians. It can strike down a 
    healthy person with shocking suddenness, or it can take someone who has lain
    ill and abed for years, someone for whom death might actually be a blessing.
    </p>

  <p>And therein lies the key to understanding how Death's Messengers choose to
    conduct themselves. In addition to the physical maladies they cause 
    directly, the messengers savor every opportunity they can get to torment a 
    victim with fear and anxiety. Their most favorite targets are those people 
    who know them for what they are, the people who are sure that a stabbing 
    pain or an episode of delirium is a sign that Death is on its way. In fact,
    Death may not choose to take a person so afflicted for many months or years 
    - but in the meantime, Death's Messengers will have a sadistically jolly 
    time torturing that person over and over again. A sliver of anxiety and 
    apprehension becomes a crack, then a crevice, then a chasm as the messenger
    makes repeated visits and its poor victim becomes more and more morose, 
    pessimistic, and withdrawn.</p>
    
  <p>The messengers are Pain, Dizziness, Delirium, Discomfort, Numbness, and 
    Torpor. They may visit a victim singly or in any combination, except that 
    Pain and Torpor do not usually consort together, because one tends to offset
    the effect ofthe otherbut
when they do visit at the same time, the cumulative
effect can be more torturous than the most
vicious punishment that one man can inflict upon
another: imagine, if you can, feeling excruciating
pain while being unconscious and helpless to do
anything to alleviate it.
The messengers are usually invisible' Delirium is
never visible, but its presence serves as a catalyst for
any or all of the other messengers to show themselves
ifthey so desire. It attacks the sensory mechanisms
and the brain directly, causing the victim to
see or hear or smell things that don't really existexcept
in his mind.
Pain takes whatever visual form most closely
corresponds to the kind ofhurt the victim is suffering:
a ball of flame for a burning sensation, a bloody
dagger or knife for a stabbing pain, a body being
crushed by an enorlnous weight to simulate a dull
and persistent ache.
Dizziness is an amorphous form that swirls and
pulses sickeningly, making the viewer disoriented
and nauseous.
Discomfort may appear as large weights tied to
the victim's wrists. If the subject is instead afllicted 
with buzzing in the ears, discomfort resembles a
grotesque bumblebee that constantly hovers along-
Jide hii tt"ad and cannotbe swatted or shooed away.
Numbness can be a terrifying sight. If it causes a
victim to lose the feeling in his foot, for instance,
then it appears as an empty space separating the
foot frorn-the rest of the body. If it affects a victim's
entire body, a condition known as paralysis, thenthe
victim peiceives that the very air around him has
turned iolid and murky, making independent movement
impossible. The victim can be lifted and moved
b-v someonee lse, but cannot initiate such actions'
Toroor manifests as a faceless, floating figure

,-,:1-t:f,.blackness envelops the victim and brings with it
form and its effect on a victim, is often mistaken for

,J * If you have ever suffered a pain that no medicine
would alleviate, don't blame your physician. If your
hand has ever "fallen asleep" for no apparent reason,
now you know what the reason might be. If you lrave
ever been overcome by a feeling that something
about the world around you is suddenly and horribly
unreal, don't look for a rational explanation. Admit
to yourself, and be mindful ofthe fact, that you have
been visited by Deatir"s Messengers. They may be
trying to tell you that your demise is imminent, but
it is just as likely that they are more interested in
tormenting you... so that when Death does come for
you, youwillwelcome, ratherthan dread, its arrival.</p>

Not every one of the Messengers has all of
the special abilities listed below, but most of
thern-have most of them, if you know what we
mean (or even if you don't). For instance, Torpor
doesn't h ave creature feature; it only-matelioli""
t in one specifrc form. Delirium doesn't
rnaterialize, but (as Prof. Tobin figured out) the
other Messengers only become visible after :
Delirium is already present. When a Messen- ',1ii
ger visits a victim, it takes pleasure in causing
iain, dizziness, or whatever. But the bottomiine
goal of every Messenger is to make the
victim mortally afraid that he's about to die. Of
all the spirits that are capable of scaring some'
one to death, these guys are the experts.</p>
