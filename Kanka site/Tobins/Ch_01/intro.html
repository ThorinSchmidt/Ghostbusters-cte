			<p>We must begin where man began, in the cradle of ciuilization. Here our 
				ancestors fi,rst set down words for us to read, and here we read of rnan's
				first encounters with unearthly spirits.</p>
			<p>The two great river ciuilizations of the ancient Middle East, those of
				Egypt and of Mesopotamia (Iiterally, "the land between the riuers")
				developed at roughly the same tirne in hurnan history and under somewhat
				the same conditions. They also deueloped adjacent to one another, and thus
				rnay have encountered the sarne spirits.</p>
			<p>I haue spent much of my time and space in this volume on Egypt, as I 
				have a fondness for and an intellectual delight in that culture particularly,
				but I have taken pains to find room for singularly impressiue spirits beyond 
				the banks of the Nile. The M esopotarnian empires of Assyria and Babylonia 
				are represented, as well as ancient Sumer, and I have gone so far afield as India
				for a contrast. But let us start where my heart belangs. - Tobin</p>
			<p>The Spirit Guide, as an additional homage to Tobin's seminal work, is divided into
				the original 4 world regions.  This has required The Guide to add a few other regions 
				which might otherwise logically be part of another. For this, we slightly apologize.  
				Keeping the bulk of Tobin's work together for this edition was our key consideration.
