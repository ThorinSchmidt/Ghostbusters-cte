<h4>Ahagotsu</h4>

<p> J.H. Tobin's first real encounter with the supernatral was an encounter
with the mummy of Ahagotsu. Because of this, the original entry in Tobin's
Spirit Guide reads more as a naraative, and less of a scientific essay.</p>

<p>Because of this, his narrative is not inclided as part of the main entry.
However, interested readers should definitely check the link included here
as The Ahagotsu Affair provides not only an interesting tale, but glimpse
into Tobin himself, as well as his long-time partner, Shrewsbury Smith.</p>

<p>Here then is what we know about Ahagotsu:</p>

<p>Known to history as "The Clown Pharoah of Egypt", His jokes might have
been funny once (and only once), but Ahagotsu doesn't know how unfunny he
is - and his victim had better not break the news to him. He lives (in a
manner of speaking) to cause laughter. He can poltergeist anything ever
thrown by the Three Stooges, and when he wants some tips on delivery and
timing he might summon pests in the forms of the world's most awful 
burlesque comedians.</p>
