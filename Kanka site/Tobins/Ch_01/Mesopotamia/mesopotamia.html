    <p>Lacking any introduction from Shrewsbury, here is brief excerpt
      from History.com concerning Mesopotamia:</p><br>
      
    <blockquote>
      <p>Humans first settled in Mesopotamia in the Paleolithic era. By 14,000
        B.C., people in the region lived in small settlements with circular
        houses.</p>

      <p>Five thousand years later, these houses formed farming communities 
        following the domestication of animals and the development of 
        agriculture, most notably irrigation techniques that took advantage of 
        the proximity of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.</p>

      <p>Agricultural progress was the work of the dominant Ubaid culture, which
        had absorbed the Halaf culture before it.</p>
      
      <p>These scattered agrarian communities started in the northern part of
        the ancient Mesopotamian region and spread south, continuing to grow for
        several thousand years until forming what modern humans would recognize
        as cities, which were considered the work of the Sumer people.</p>
        
    </blockquote><br>
      
    <p>Where you have people, you have curiousity, and a desire to explain the 
      world.  These explanations became beliefs, myths, and superstitions. these
      in turn gave rise to (or attracted) gods and spirits, along with those 
      certain early humans who for one reason or another, did not "pass on".</p>
      
    <p>It is from Mesopotamia that the oldest of the spirits that flock to
      (plague?) our world come.  Many have assumed other guises, habits and 
      names through the eons, but their fundamental natures remain the same.</p>
