		<h3>India</h3>
		<p>India. It is a large peninsula on the southern edge of the Asian 
      continent; it was once considered to be the "Crown Jewel of the British
      Empire."  Now thankfully independent once more, India is still a land
      full of mystery and magic. It was long isolated from the rest of the 
      world, and was(is) home to powerful gods, magicians, and strange beasts.
      Even today, many "undiscovered" areas still exist, isolated from the 
      Modern World.</p>
      
    <p>Even in Shrewsbury Smith's time however, the "powers" of India were
      beginning to escape their long exile, making their presence felt in  the
      wider world through the Industrial West's ever-growing sphere of commerce.
