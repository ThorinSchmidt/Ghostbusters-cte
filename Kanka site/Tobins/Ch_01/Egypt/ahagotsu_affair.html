<h4>The Ahagotsu Affair</h4>
<h5>An account by J.H. Tobin</h5>

<p>My frrst experience with an Egyptian spirit in fact took place in England
in 1899. I was a clerk in the Alexandria office of my company, but I had
returned to London when my father took ill. As fate would have it, he died
two weeks after my arrival. I took a leave of indeterminate length because,
as the man of the family, I was obliged to settle my father's estate.</p>

<p>During this time I became involved in what I have since referred to as
the Ahagotsu Affair, and, as well, made my first acquaintance with that
intrepid adventurer and my good friend Shrewsbury Smith. Properly grieving
for my father, I had not paid .much attention to the newspapers, so I did not
know of the terror that was taking place in the East End of the city. But what
a terror it was! The poor pantomime troupe at the Hobb's Lane Music Hall 
were not only receiving bad reviews from the critics but were being stalked
by some hideous East End phantom. 

<p>Was this a reappearance of Jack the Ripper (or someone like him), the
nefarious murderer of young women, turning his attention to other victims? 
Thus the papers speculated, and thus I believed, until a mysterious stranger
called uponme in the middle of a rain-soaked night. The visitor stood six
feet tall, square-shouldered and square-jawed, with the rugged good looks
that one generally attributes to an Eton man. He wore a long wool overcoat
and a battered brimmed hat, both of which had seen better days. When he
spoke, I was amazed to hear the lilting, Celtic sound of the collieries
instead of a clipped, well-bred English accent.</p>

<p>'Will you be Mister Tobin, then?" he asked politely. "Late of Alexandria
in Egypt?"</p>

<p>"That is correct," I replied.</p>

<p>"Then I am in desperate need of your assistance. May I come in?"</p>

<p>I let the visitor into my house, and so began my long friendship with
Mr. Shrewsbury Smith. He quickly told me his story. He was in fact a
Welshman, though born in Shropshire and rather well educated. He had seen
service in India and Africa, and only recently retired from the arrny.</p>

<p>He knew one of the women who had vanished at Hobb's Lane Music Hall, and
he could not be satisfred with the conduct of the police in that matter. He
had something to show me - evidence that he believed Scotland Yard had 
overlooked. He reached into his vest pocket and pulled out several paper 
pages.</p>

<p>On each page, drawn in an irregular hand, were signs and symbols which
I recognized instantly. I demanded an explanation. He explained. Shrewsbury
is like that. He does not waste words.</p>

The company at Hobb's Lane was not a particularly
talented one. If the music hall's regular audience
had demanded talent from the performers, in
fact, the members of this company would probably
not be working there. But the regular audience was
uncouth and hard-drinking. Bawdy songs and unsophisticated
humor, limericks and liquor were enough
to satis$ the normal crowd at Hobb's Lane. Even
this degree ofentertainment stretched the talents of
the troupe to their limits.
The papers I held in my hands had frrst appeared
at Hobb's Lane some weeks ago, mysteriously delivered
to the desk of the troupe manager, Mr. Sears
Wornwell. To Wornwell, they were just crude pic- :,..:
tures on paper. He mentioned them casually to some
'
members ofthetroupe (fromwhomShrewsbury sub-' :
sequently learned about the incident), and threw
them in his wastebasket. Indeed, Wornwell received
another such "gift" a few days after the first-and
two days afterhe crumpled and discardedthe second
message, Sears Wornwell disappeaied. Witnesses
saw him go into his office, but no one ever saw him
leave.
Life went on at Hobb's Lane; since Wornwell was
neither very popular nor very efficient as a manager,
no one thought much of his absence. Many patrons
were heard to remark that the show was better off
without him, while others observed that any change
in the troupe would have been an improvement. .,::ii
Papers with similar drawings next appeared on'':."
the dressing room table of Polly Porter, the woman
Shrewsbury had known. I assume that she was a
friend of his sistet's, or perhaps someone whom he
hadmetinchurch. The symbols onthese pages must
have meant little to Miss Porter, and like Wornwell
she apparently mentioned them in passing to others
in the troupe but thereafter ignored them. A day
later, on the stage at Hobb's Lane, as she began the
second chorus of "The French Floozy's Lament,"
Miss Porter was abducted.
Both of the sober witnesses in the audience that
evening told police the same story. Miss Porter had
trouble with breath control, and she had to draw a
second deep breath in the middle of the word "turpentine"
in the third line of the chorus. The witnesses
remember this, because for them it was the
high point of Miss Porter's performance, if not the
high point of the entire show, and they waited to
begin drinking until after it had taken place.
But I digress.... The witnesses told police that
suddenly a hideously deformed creature dropped
onto the stage from somewhere in the rafters above.
It could have been human, for it had legs and arms
where those limbs usually are placed. It moved
slowly and awkwardly, and it was dressed in tattered
rags which clung grotesquely to its body. Miss
Porter stopped in the middle of her second breath
and stared dumbly at the creature. It bent forward,
apparently in some sort of a bow, frrst to the audience
and then to Miss Porter. It then began to shuflle
its feet in an odd manner, as if it were having trouble
standing up. The audience began to throw things
onto the stage. The creature made a deep, unearthly
growl and swept Miss Porter into its arms. The
witnesses think that she fainted as it ran offstage
with her. She has never been seen again.
'That thinghas come backtwice now,' Shrewsbury
told me. "It's taken two more people, and one ofthem
is the only clown the troupe had. He's not very funny,
but there's supposed to be a clown." He pointed to the
papers I held. "Trash never gets thrown away at
Hobb's Lane. These are the strange messages that
each person received before he or she was abducted.
I think I know what they are, and I have been told
that you will be able to read them."
Of course I could read them. It was not for nothing
that I had taken a degree in Obscure Ancient Lan-
-Suages at Oxford. The symbols on each page were
ancient hieroglyphics, the crude system of writing
that developed in Egypt thousands of years ago.
What I held in my hand was not ancient writing,
however. Some ofthe symbols were drawn on newspapers
with last month's football scores on them!
I went to my study desk and lit the lamp there.
Shrewsbury followed me, and on my desk we arranged
the messages in order oftheir appearance.
Painstakingly I began my translation. The results
were astonishing. The first, receivedbyMr. Wornwell,
read as follows:
There once was a Kushite from Edfu
Who had troubl,e assembling his tutu.
From ballet it d.etracted
And on his body it acted
A lot like the Nile cataracted.
"My God, that's awful," Shrewsbury said. "ft's
worse than the limericks the troupe uses. Are you
certain that's what it says?"
"Yes, quite." My mind raced as I nodded to
Shrewsbury. The Kushites were an ancient people
who lived in the region of the Sudan. Edfu was an
ancient city in southern Egypt. A cataract was a
point in a river where the water spilled over a large
cliffor precipice. Today we call it a waterfall. What
performer in his right mind would include these
words in a limerick? More importantly, who on
Earth would think this was funny?
I translated the second message. My horror grew.
The third. skit is too subtle. When the d.ragon
dnclares his loue to St. George instead of the
princess, the audience may not see the joke.
Haue the dragon build a giant stonc tomb for
George. That should make it clear.
I heard Shrewsbury gasp behind me as he read
the translation over my shoulder. I knew how he felt.
I remember distinctly the cold perspiration on my
brow as I began the next translation. Myhand could
barely hold the pen steady as I wrote.
The joke about gouernrnent is wond,erful. An
opposition political party is a hilarious idea.
May I use that joke in my routine?
This affair had become about something much
more important than the disappearance of a few bad
actors and the dwindling attendance at a mediocre
East End music hall. Whatever wrote this had aspirations
to the stage. IfShrewsbury and I could not
somehow stop this thing, the entirety of British
humor as we understand it could be in danger.
There were further clues on the pages, clues not
connected with the translation, clues that only
someone trained such as I could detect. Just as we
English no longer spell our words the way that r'
Geoffrey Chaucer did in the fourteenth century, so ,i
the Egyptians of different eras used different s5rm- ,'''
bols to refer to the same thing. These hieroglyphs
were particularly distinctive, because only during
the brief reign of one Old Kingdom pharaoh was the
depiction of a ram-headed man kicking another man
inlhe buttocks the symbol for the word "hilarious."
Whatever had written these horrible messages had
learned to write hieroglyphics as they were written
in the reign ofthe pharaoh Ahagotsu.
Smith and I rode a cab toHobb's Lane Music Hall,
determined to look for more clues to this baffling
mystery. The theater was dark and deserted, but
Smitfr forced the door open and our lanterns pro- ,
vided us with adequate light for our search. As we
worked our way past the dressing rooms, we heard
a strange sound coming from the stage. Smith and I
exchanged nervous glances. Neither of us could
recognize the odd moaning. Smith reached under his
overcoat and pulled out a pistol. I felt better, and we
cautiously advanced toward the stage.
We entered at the rear of the room, behind the
theater seats. Down on stage was a horrifring sight.
The thing that the witnesses had described, this
thing that perhaps had once been human, stood on
the stage wrapped in rags, wearing a black top hat
and a clown's round red nose. It shufiled its feet in
some kind ofhideous dance and spread its arms wide
as if it were receiving applause. And then it bowed to
the empty seats. ft's a mummy!" f whispered to
Smith. "It's an Eryptian mummy!"
"That is what ran offwith Polly!" he declared. He
tooktwo strides forward and aimed his pistol, firing
a shot that clearly penetrated the mummy's chest as
the creature rose from its second bow.
Thebullethad no effect whatsoever. The mummy
removed its top hat and pulled out of it a large white
rabbit. If the bullet had done any damage, the thing
could not have accomplished that trick.
The mummy ran offstage right. The rabbit exited
stage left. Smith and I ran after the mummy. We
followed it backstage, always able to hear the sound
of its stiff, worn rags sliding across the dusty floor.
Then suddenly we heard nothing. Our lanterns
showed us only tantalizing Shadows of prop guillotines
and clothing mannequins. Smith shot one of
the mannequins, just so the others would not get any
ideas. It seemed reasonable to me at the time.
"Look," Smith said. I knelt to shine my lantern on
the ground. The marks wherethe mummy'sfeethad
slid through the sawdust were clearly visible. We
followed them and turned a corner. Smith shot
anothermannequin. Then we reached aplace, inthe
middle of what appeared to be an empty storage
room, where the mummy prints just stopped. They
didn't lead anywhere, and they gave no clues. It
looked as if the mummyhadvanished in mid-flight.
Smith strode to the point in the floor where the
tracks stopped and shot it. I was mildly startled.
Smith fired once more into the floor and then knelt
to inspect the damage. "The light, Tobin," he said to
me. "Bring me your light."
I did as I was told and together we saw that the
bullets had not imbedded themselves in the wood of
the floor. Instead, they had gone neatly through,
leaving two clean holes in the planks. "It's hollow
underneath there," I exclaimed. Smith nodded and
stamped his foot hard on the wood. The floor planks
splintered and broke away, revealing a shallow
passageway that dropped below the theater.
Smith lowered himself into the passage and held
his lantern out. "I see several more,'he said. "There
are tunnels in all directions down here. Two men
alone will never be able to search them."
That was it, then. We left the theater and called
on Scotland Yard. We told the detectives there that
Sears Wornwell, Polly Parker, and the other missing
: . -
troupe members, if they were still alive, were being
kept in the network of tunnels underneath Hobb's
Lane Music Hall. I began to explain what it was that
had abducted them,. but Smith stopped me. Over
breakfast, he explained why.
"That thing is from a world outside of their experience,
Tobin," he told me between bites of kippers
and stewed tomatoes. "The police are good men, but
not educated men. Do you think they would take us
seriously if we explained to them that a two-thousand-
year-old mummifred Egyptian who wanted to
break into show business had kidnapped Polly and
the others? I'm having a bit of diffrculty with the
concept myself, and I went to public schoolz!"
I quite saw his point. Bullets hadn't halted that
thing. I rather doubted that anything we modern
people understood was likely to have an effect on it,
either. It was then that I hit upon the idea of
researching the situation in the family library.
Perhaps the ancients themselves had anticipated
such a problem, and discovered a way to solve it.
After what seemed like hours of poring over the
collection of transcriptions from Old Kingdom Egypt
that my father and I had amassed over the years, I
believed I had hit upon the solution' The Egyptians
then were not, by and large, as concerned as we are
2InE ngland, a public schooli s an exclusiuep riuate school,a nd the
public ges to Comprehensiues chool.W herec omprehensiuesg o.'..
today about mummies coming back to life. But there
was one mummy of one pharaoh that the sources all
show greatly concerned the ancient Egyptians. That
pharaoh was Ahagotsu, the clown-king of Egypt.
The ancient Egyptians buried their pharaoh with
all that they thought he would need in his life after
death. They buried warrior pharaohs with chariots
and spears, for instance. They buried their pharaohs
with food and gold, and in some cases with mummified
servants to attend the kings in the afterlife. The
records of the building of the tomb ofAhagotsu show
that he was buried with large, messy, cream-covered
1. pastries, with hollow, bladder-like cushions that
- emitted an embarrassing sound when sat upon, and
iti'ith other such odd, unkingly things.
:r,' For reasons not entirely clear in the chronicles,
though I suspect they were as worried about the
future ofEgyptianhumor as we were about ourown,
the priests and people ofancient Egypt were very
concerned that Ahagotsu never return to the land of
the living. At the conclusion of one ofthe accounts of
the pharaoh's reign, a scribe had written:
Should the body of Ahagotsu euer again walk
the banks of the riuer Nih, take heart, for there
isarernedy. Deep inthepharaoh's ou)ntomb we
haue placed a scarab made of channed sardonyx.
Place that scarab on the body of
Ahagotsu's n'tutrLtny, and he will giue you no
problem.
Aft,er nearly a full day of searching through seemingly
endless, dusty, stiff-paged books, I had found
the solution! Archaeologists had partially excavated
the pyramid-tomb of Ahagotsu near Memphis.
Shrewsbury and I could book passage on a ship to
Alexandria, travel to Memphis, find the scarab
charm, and retum to England to put an end to the
mummy menace in a matter of months.
I A gentleman from Scotland Yard called that aftertroon.
His men had found Wornwell, Polly Parker,
and the other missing members of the troupe in the
tunnels beneath the music hall. They were alive, but
nearly deranged from their ordeal. They had been
forced to endurejoke afterjoke, prank after prank,
comedy so horrible and unfunny that only an American
could have endured it and emerged unaffected.
The mummy ofAhagotsu was nowhere to be found.
He remained hidden in the dark hallways under
London. Shrewsbury and I still had a job to do.
I had originally planned to return to Erypt anyway,
to continuewithmybusiness career. The search
. for the scarab charm and the hope of ridding London
ofAhagotsu now gave thejourney a greater purpose.
I spent mytime readingallthe literature thatl could
about Egyptian amulets and charms. The work of
Dr. E. A. Wallis Budge proved particularly fascinat- ' ing and, I hoped, would be useful.
t Every society in the world seems to have its own
version ofamulets, charms ortalismans, little pieces
ofjewelry which people believe possess some kind of
magical power. These charms are made of simple
natural materials, but are usually distinct in some
way such as color or texture. Stones with unusual
colors or markings are very often made into charms
and talismans. The ancient Egyptians liked to carve
their charms into distinctive shapes, and one of the
most common shapes was that of the scarab beetle.
The scarab beetle was important to the Eryptians
because they believed that the god Khepera rolled
the sun across the sky just the way that the scarab
beetle rolled a ball ofdung across the earth. I put
aside Dr. Budge's notes and left my cabin to take a
stroll on the deck. Standing there, watching the
familiar European shore grow ever smaller in the
distance, I felt a twinge of-how shall I put this?*
foreboding about our upcoming adventure. I pulled
out the translation that I had made of the ancient
chronicler's instructions and looked at it again.
Place that scarab on the body of Ahagotsu's
rnu,mrny, and he will giue you no problem.
I was reassured.
After alongjourney over sea and land, Shrewsbury
and I arrived at Memphis. We faced the unknown,.
the deadly and mysterious spirit world. My blood
raced through my veins as we plotted the strategy of
our assault onAhagotsu's pyramid tomb. Shrewsbury
thought that the more people we took into the
coming conflict, the more likely that some number of
them would survive, and the more likely that some
of them would be us. I chided him for his gallows
sense ofhumor and explained that I could not in good
conscience endanger innocent lives.
So we stood, two men alone, on a windswept,
dusty desert plain outside Memphis. Before us rose
a majestic stone structure, pointed at the top and
broad at the base. Here, in this pyramid, the terror
beneath the Hobb's Lane Music Hall would meet its
match. Here the Ahagotsu Affair would end!
"How do we get in, then?" Shrewsbury asked.
Our spirits only slightly dampened, we rode back
to Memphis in search of a local guide. An archaeological
team had partially excavated the site, and
over the years the tomb of Ahagotsu had been plundered
by grave robbers. There must be someone in
this city who could locate the entrance. Shrewsbury
found a small boy who-for a modest fee-would
show us a secret passage in the tomb wall.
So we stood, two men and a boy, alone on a
windswept, dusty desert plain outside Memphis,
once again ready to put an end to the earthly existence
ofAhagotsu. The boy pressed a secret stone in
the wall of the pyramid, and a door reluctantly
groaned open to reveal a narrow passageway.
Shrewsbury lit a kerosene lantern and handed it
forward to me. I stepped into the ancient passage,
and almost immediately a small form hurtled out of
the darkness at my head.
I quickly ducked, and whateverit was flew past
me and into the sunlight. I heard an unpleasant
thud, and when I looked back I saw Shrewsbury
lvins unconscious in the sand. The boy guide ran off
ttwird the city in the distance, crying out prayers in
his native tongue. I scrambled to my friend's side.
The flying object had struck Shrewsbury squarely in
the face,ind a thin trickle of blood now lined his
forehead. His eyelids flickered, and I realized that
he was only stunned. I searched for the object that
had flown out at us. There it was-some kind of
stone. I scrambled overto it, and Shrewsbury crawled
on his belly to see what had struck him. It was stone
all right, but only become so by the ravages of !im-e,
:t, OncJit had been light and sugary and no doubt
sticky and sweet. We could make out the hardened
crust and the petrified frlling.
. "A custard pie," Shrewsbury muttered, wiping
bloodfromhis face and murmuringwords to himself
that I dare not repeat. "A no-account custard pie!"
"A trap that was never sprung," I said. 'A prlctical
joke waiting all these centuries to be played."
My intrepid friend sprang to his feet. "You're sure
that what's in this tomb will get the bugger?"
"All we have to do is place the scarab on his body,
and then he will give us no problem."
"Then let's get on with it, mate."
We strode into the secret passage with renewed
determination. The way was dark and treacherous,
a narrow, winding corridor with surprises at every
turn. Around one corner we found a strangely pleasant
garden full of bright flowers. The sight wal so
uneipected that we stopped in our tracks. "They
can't be real," Shrewsbury said, and he was right.
When he bent to examine one, it shot a brief stream
of dark dust into his face. He stood, unable to grin
but unableto getfullyirate. That dust, ofcourse, had
been ink before the passage of time had dried it up.
After tribulations too numerous to mention,
Shrewsbury and I finally reached alarge room filled
with stone furniture. Tomb robbers had of course
long ago removed any valuables from the room, but
the open, empty case that had once held the mummy
Ahagotsu told us that we had at last found the room
we sought. Shrewsbury sank down into one of the
oversized stone chairs. The chair made a rude bathroom
sound, and a cloud of dust blew out from
beneath my friend's rump.
"So, Tobin," he growled. 'Where is this scarab
amulet, eh?" Frustrated, I shook my head. We moved
along the far wall, tapping lightly' I found a loose
bricli and pressed, and the whole wall gave way. We
stepped back and avoided the cascade of petrifred
pies and cakes that fell down, breaking into tiny
pieces of rock on the floor. The wall slid completely
iside, and we saw the room that it had hidden' We
had found what we were looking for!
Shrewsbury lifted the kerosene lamp high above
his head, so that its light shone on the entire room'
It was empty save for one thing in the middle of the
dusty floor: a rose-colored stone carving ofa scarab
beetie! How could the tomb robbers fail to make off
with a treasure such as this? Simple-the scarab
was some five feet long and three feet wide.
Shrewsbury set down his lamp and walked over to it,
and the thing came up nearly to his waist. He bent
to push it, to try to move it in any way, but he was
unsuccessful. "fobin, the thing must weigh a ton,"
he finally said. "If we could set this on the mummy's 1.1
body, ofcourse it would give us no problem-if,d:,:r
crush the thing into dust!" , t.''
My new fiend Shrewsbury and I sp,ent many
y"u", in "u"h other's company thereafter. I never-did
ieportbackforwork as alowlyclerk-now that I had
found my true calling. And Shrewsbury likewise
needed nb prompting to continue along the path his
life had taken. Since both of us were men of independent
means with a desire to make our marks on
ihe world, we formed a team and resolved to spend
our lives researching and, if necessary' combating
the denizens of the spirit world who had made their
way onto this mortal coil.
And we further resolved, each in his own mind,
never to give up the ghost, as it were-never agaq
to admitlo failure in a quest as we had been forced
to do at the end of the Ahagotsu Affair. Shrewsbury
never mentioned this incident again, but I have a
feeling he never forgot about it, either. He shared the
remorse that I feel because we were never able to
stop the mummy of Ahagotsu-never able to save
Brilish humor from the fate which it has met today.
