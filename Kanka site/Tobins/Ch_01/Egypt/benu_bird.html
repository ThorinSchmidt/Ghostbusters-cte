<h4>The Benu Bird</h4>

<p>The human tendencyto associate birds with time goes back, I am persuaded,
to the Benu Bird.</p>

<p>The first water, called Nun, flowed like a river through nothing. The world
- and time - began when a bird, the Benu Bird, flew over Nun, landed on a
rock in the middle of the water and let out a piercing call - which broke
the silence of Nun. Light shone for the first time. Life came into the
world.</p>

<p>The priests of the Benu Bird gave thanks for the 24 hours ofthe day,
for the 365 days of the calendar year. They thanked the Benu Bird for the
1460 years between the time when the calendar year and the ,solar year
began and ended on the same day. They corrected anyone who miscalculated
any measurements of the calendar or the clock.</p>

<p>Even after the last priests died, the Benu Bird continued its work. 
Witness the lament of a Roman sculptor who erred in his dating of a monument
to Caesar Augustus in 28 B.C.:</p>

<p>Auicilla auicilla in caelo<br>
Cur illud fecitis in occulo m.eo<br>

<p>(Roughly tranelated;</p>

<p>Little bird, Iittle bird, in the sky<br>
Why did you do that in my eye?)</p>

<p>The spirit's punishment for inaccurate dating is swift and messy.
Statuary is regularly inscribed with dates. Is it any wonder that statues
and monuments are regular targets of the Benu Bird? It should not surprise
us that many historians to this day spend more time indoors than do normal
people, or that when they venture out they usually wear hats. The Swiss and
the Germans seem particularly susceptible to this spirit's spell.</p>

<p>The bird's Ectopresence is strongest where it doesn't have a lot to do,
such as the Greenwich Naval Observatory, and weakest in places where nobody
seems to care about exact time, such as a sleepy Mexican village (where the
only measure of time is often "manana"(sic)) or a baseball game (which, in
theory, can go on forever).</p>
