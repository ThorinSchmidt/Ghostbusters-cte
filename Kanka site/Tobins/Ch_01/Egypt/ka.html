<blockquote>
<h4>Ka</h4>

<p>We have the ancient Eryptians to thank for the earliest recorded 
commentary on a phenomenon of the spirit world that is unequaled by
any other, both in the frequency of its occurrence and in the effect it has
on the human race.</p>

<p>From what we know of genetics, even though that science is still in
its infancy, we have good reason to believe that no two people living on
earth, even so called identical twins, look exactly alike. From there it is
a short jump to the theory that each of the thousands of millions of human
beings who has ever lived is in some way visually distinguishable from all
the others.</p>

<p>Yet, every person does have a double - an absolute duplicate of himself
or herself in appearance and mannerisms. This "other person" spends at
least some of its existence in the realm of ether. If and when it travels to the
physical realm, it can produce a remarkable, perhaps pivotal, change in the
life of the mortal being whom it mirrors.</p>

<p>The Egyptians used the word "ka" to refer to the essence of each 
individual human being - those qualities and properties that set the
person apart from all others.</p>

<p>Through the ages, this type of spirit has been given many names by
many cultures, and a myriad interpretations have been attached to the 
significance of its appearance. In Scotland this spirit is called the fetch; 
in Germany, the doppelganger, and in both of those cultures it generally 
has a negative connotation - a person who sees his double is soon destined
to die. Jewish lore, on the other hand, maintains that to see one's double
is good luck because it endows the person with the ability to know his own
future.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter seems to be that encountering one's double 
produces a result that is as unpredictable as the fact of whether or not
the double will appear to begin with. The result of a meetingbetween a
person and his other self depends on uncountable variables. All we can do
to prepare ourselves for the possibility is to believe that the possibility 
exists - and that is the only purpose that this essay can hope to achieve.</p>

<p>A double may try to communicate with one either vocally or through 
gestures. It may remain mute and motionless, leaving its victim to imagine
or deduce why it has come. It may appear not before its victim but before
people who know him, and it may do or say something that he benefits from
or suffers for at a later time.</p>

<p>Do not go looking for your ethereal ka, for whether or not you find it
is not up to you. Do not try to predetermine what will happen when it does
appear, because you cannot dictate the circumstances under which that 
might occur. Just be aware that it could happen, and live your life 
accordingly.</p>

<p>- Tobojn</p>

<p>If one sees a ka that isn't his or hers, one might not know it's a ka
or what model ka it is. (Late-model kas all seem to look the same.)</p>

<p>If a person ever meets his own ka, he or she has to be very Cool not to
be frightened out of his or her skin. If he tries to drive his ka away, it
reads his mind (which is, afber all, its mind) and knows exactly what the
person plans to do. The real problem is that in addition to the victim's
mind, every ka has a mind of its own. It does what it thinks is best for 
itself - which may or may not be best for the person.</p>
