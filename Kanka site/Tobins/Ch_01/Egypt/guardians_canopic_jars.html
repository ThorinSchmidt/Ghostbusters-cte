<blockquote><h4>The Guardians of the Canopic Jars</h4>
<p>The Egyptians practiced the most bizarre and disgusting rituals of death. We know much about them because the
	mummified corpses of their princes have survived for our archaeologists to examine. For a royal burial, the Egyptian
	undertakers removed the internal organs of the human body and buried the body in a coffin. The liver, lungs, stomach
	and intestines of the deceased they stored in separate jars which were interred with the coffin. Selkis, Isis, Neith and
	Nephthys were the spirits in charge of guarding the organ containers, called the Canopic Jars.</p>

<p><u>Selkis Who Cools Throats</u> is perhaps the most ttoublesome of these guardians because it is she who is
	most ofben summoned by evil men. Not only does Selkis guard the entrails ofthe embalmed dead, she is also Mistress
	of the House of Books, the Nubian patroness of magic. I myself have encountered the Throat-Cooler, and she is a
	terrible thing to behold. If you see a beautiful woman across a crowded dance floor, and if she has a giant living
	scorpion curled around her head, she is probably Selkis Who Cools Throats. and she will not know how to waltz.</p>
	
<p>Selkis appears as a gorgeous African Woman in stylish clothing. She possesses incredible knowledge of lost Nubian
	magic, which she teaches in very small doses to those who follow her. She holds great power over the organs of the
	body that are in the jars she guards, and her followers'magic also affects these organs. Selkis controls the functions of
	the upper and lower intestines. Legends tell that she also can summon the scorching heat of the desert, and the 
	combination of the two powers must adversely affect one's sense of smell. Finally, there is that scorpion atop her 
	head....</p>
	
<p><u>Isis</u> is another of the guardians of the Canopic Jars, as well as the Egyptian spirit of wifely fidelity and 
	maternal care. Somehow, this spirit has gained a reputation for seduction and beauty. My research indicates that this is
	not warranted; in fact, she is quite bovine, even down to the cow's horns which sprout from her forehead. If the curse
	of Isis falls upon a man, she dotes on his every need. No sneeze takes place without the spirit appearing and forcing
	the poor man prone under the nearest available covering. One may detect the presence of the spirit, even if she is
	invisible, by the sickly odor of chicken soup that follows her everywhere.</p>

<p>Isis guards the jar of the liver, and must control the function of that organ. I have no independent confirmation of 
	that hypothesis, however; my colleagues who began research into this matter each became utter alcoholics and 
	abandoned the work.</p>

<p><u>Neith</u> guards the CanopicJ ar that contains the stomach. One of the reasons for her having this 
	responsibility may be the fact that in some renderings she is depicted as the earth-mother cow who nurses Re, the
	sun-god, to keep him frt and healthy as he makes his daily journey across the sky. The cow, like other ruminants, is
	unusual in the respect that it has a sophisticated, four-chambered stomach - something the ancient Egyptians must
	have been aware of just as we are. Neith is also known for her role as an arbitrator in the battle for control of the world
	between Horus and Set - the sort of job that most people (and, presumably, spirits) do not have the stomach for. When
	she chooses to become visible, Neith appears as a tall woman with a bow and a sheaf of arrows slung over her 
	shoulders, and a shield clutched in both hands in front of her abdomen. If a person's stomach looks like it needs
	help in particular, if it is distended from overindulgence she hands him her shield, and then she and the object vanish.
	Thereafter, for as long as her control Iasts, the victim feels disgust at the thought of eating, and if he actually ingests
	some food, he becomes nauseous, perhaps to the point that the food refuses to stay where he has put it.</p>
	
<p>If she is in the mood for a prank, she can cause one's stomach to growl as though one has not eaten for days. Or she 
	can make her victim's trousers unbearably tight, so that he or she immediately loosens them (with predictable results).
	</p>
	
<p>And frnally there is <u>Nephthys</u>, the guardian of the lungs, who is also the sister of Isis. In fact, this
	familial connection is apparently the only reason why Nephthys was afforded the responsibility of being the fourth
	guardian. Everylhing we know about her suggests that she was something of a misfit, who could not succeed at 
	anything more complicated than jar-guarding.</p>
	
<p>During the early period of her existence, Nephthys was the antithesis of what her sister stood for, that being 
	wifely fidelity and maternal care. In some respects, it seems as though Nephthys still has not changed her ways.
	When she appears before a victim, she is in the form of a strikingly beautiful woman, sufficiently attractive to take
	a man's breath away even from across a room. When Nephthys departs, it is usually because Isis has come to fetch
	her little sister - or so I must surmise from the frequency of reports that once the beautiful woman is out of his
	presence, the man she bewitched begins consuming liquor and does not stop until he is thoroughly intoxicated.</p>
	
<p>Duringthe time of the New Kingdom, the custom of removing organs from the body of the deceased fell out of
	fashion. The Canopic Jars were an empty (literally) formality for years afterward, and finally their use was
	discontinued altogether.</p>

<p>It seems to have been around this time that the guardians, looking for something else to do, started visiting the
	mortal realm and, each in her own way, makingpeople aware -- sometimes painfully aware of how important their
	intestines, livers, stomachs, and lungs can be.</p></blockquote>
	
<h4>Selkis</h4>

<p><i>guardian of the intestines</i><br>
	If she's feeling mischievous, Selkis anirnates the victim's lower tract (making it uncontrollable). If she's really 
	nasty, she possesses his mind and makes him do what he ordinarily wouldn't have the guts for - and neither she
	nor he (in his possessed state) care about the consequences.</p>
	
<h4>Isis</h4>

<p><i>guardian ofthe liuer</i><br>
	Isis's material form is that of a matronly nurse (wearing a cap to hide her horns). Once she has selected a
	"beneficiary" for her care, she <i>summons pesfs</i>: pills that appear before the patient every four to six hours, not to
	exceed six doses in twenty-four hours.</p> 

<p>If he protests too much or gives her a hard time in some other way, Isis uses her ability to dematerialize the 
	contents of an alcoholic beverage and makes the liquid reappear inside her victim's stomach. The "beverage" 
	may be anything from a swallow of beer to a half-gallon of vodka, depending on how offended she feels.</p>
	
<h4>Neith</h4>

<p><i>guardian of the stomach</i><br>
	Neith's ability to make someone repulsed by the thought of food, and nauseous if he does eat, is a variation of
	control mind. (How often have you been told, when you felt sick to your stomach, that it was all in your head?)
	The degree of nausea varies by how much food the victim swallows, ranging from I'm a Little Queasy to Where's
	the Bathroom? She can use <i>ventriloquism</i> to make the victim's stomach growl so that it's always audible 
	at least ten feet away. Neith can <i>animate</i> clothing, causing it to fold and buckle and making the garment 
	feel much smaller than it actuallv is.</p>
	
<h4>Nephthys</h4>

<p><i>guardian ofthe lungs</i><br>
	Nephthys uses <i>read mind</i> when she sashays into a room, trying to pick out the best subject for her to
	approach. When she settles on a target (usually either the biggest nerd in the bunch, or a guy who thinks he's a
	real Casanova), she <i>possesses</i> the person and makes him pant like a bloodhound that has just run 10 miles.
	Then	she uses an obscure version of <i>terrorize</i> to make the poor sucker freeze in his tracks, unable to do 
	anybhing but sigh.</p>
