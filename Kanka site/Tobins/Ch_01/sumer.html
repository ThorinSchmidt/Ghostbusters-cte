    <h1>Sumer (Sumeria)</h1>
    
    <p>Tobin had little to say about this ancient civilization. Possibly because 
      little was known, or because he simply wrote about what he liked. Either 
      reason is plausible, and frankly, it's not really something that needs to
      be defended. In an effort for completeness, however, here are a few facts
      about Sumeria, or as it is known today: Sumer.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Sumer was the southernmost region of ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day 
        Iraq and Kuwait) which is generally considered the cradle of 
        civilization. The name comes from Akkadian, the language of the north of
        Mesopotamia, and means “land of the civilized kings”. The Sumerians 
        called themselves “the black headed people” and their land, in cuneiform
        script, was simply “the land” or “the land of the black headed people” 
        and, in the biblical Book of Genesis, Sumer is known as Shinar.</p>
      
      <p>According to the Sumerian King List, when the gods first gave human 
        beings the gifts necessary for cultivating society, they did so by 
        establishing the city of Eridu in the region of Sumer. While the 
        Sumerian city of Uruk is held to be the oldest city in the world, the 
        ancient Mesopotamians believed that it was Eridu and that it was here 
        that order was established and civilization began.</p>
