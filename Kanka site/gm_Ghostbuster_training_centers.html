  <h3>GTC #13</h3>

  <p>GTC-13 was built in Savannah, GA, one of the top three "most haunted" 
    cities in the United States. No one is sure exactly why the 13th Training
    Center was built there. Did someone overlook it? Perhaps they disbelieved in
    "silly superstitions"? Or was it a statement of bravado; a challenge, as it 
    were, to the spirit world?</p>

  <p>Regardless, GTC-13 was only operational for 1 week. After that, it was 
    sealed completly, and its remaining students reassigned to other Centers. 
    All equipment and personal effects of staff and students were sealed inside
    by a special Oversight Team from the New York Headquarters.</p>

  <p class="gm_note"><b>Ghost Master's Note:</b> What's inside GTC-13? That's up to you. Maybe 
    someday I'll come up with a module for it. Until then, have fun!  If you 
    wind up making a GTC-13 adventure, send it to me; I'll include it here and 
    give you FULL CREDIT for it.</p>

<h1>Ghostbuster Training Centers</h1>

<p>Following the events of The East Room Incursion, and the subsequent Bi-
  Partisan Ghostbuster Vocational Initiative (or Buster Bill), 15 Ghostbuster 
  Training Centers (GTCs) were planned. Initially, three facilities were built.
  </p>

<p>The first, unsurprisingly, was built in New York, NY, and is the largest of 
  the GTCs. The second was built in Florida, while the third was constructed in
  Chicago. The Chicago center was somewhat controversial due to the non-
  franchise nature of Dr. Yates and her team. Nevertheless, The Chicago CTC 
  graduates are every bit as capable as their fellows.</p>

<p>Unless your campaign is set in one of the above locations, it is assumed that
  your GTC is one of the remaining 11 Centers scattered across the U.S. (or the
  world, in case this ever gets popular).  Yes, eleven. "But wait: 15-3=12!" you
  say. yup. I haven't menttioned #13 yet.</p>
  
<h2>Training Center Staff</h2>

<p class="level1">
  Each Training Center is different, and varies in the type and number of staff
  positions.  However, each center maintains a minimum of at least one of the
  following staff positions.</p>
  
<h3 class="level1">Required Positions</h3>

<h4 class="level2">Director</h4>

<p class="level3">This is the only position that is always filled by
  Ghostbusters International itself.  All other positions are usually hired
  locally by the Director, or an official head of HR.</p>

<p class="level3">The Director's role is to be the Captain of the Ship,
  providing overall direction for the Center, as well as being the Steady Rock
  when all Hell(sometimes lterally) breaks loose. It is not uncommon for this
  spot to be filled by former front-line Ghostbusters who are nearing retirement
  or who for various reasons desire to take a "less active" role within the
  organization.</p>

<h4 class="level2">Executive PA</h4>

<p class="level3">Some may dismiss this position as "Just a secretary". Don't 
  ever make that mistake where this person can hear you.  The Executive
  PA (often called simply "The PA") is the right hand of the Director, involved in all decisions, and the 
  primary mover and shaker of the Training Center's daily operations.</p>
  
<p class="level3">While The PA is not exactly in the official Business 
  Hierarchy, They are nevertheless the one to turn to in the abscence of the 
  Director.  Many an Assistant Director owes their success or failure to how 
  much or how little they heeded The PA's "advice" in a crisis.</p>
  
<h4 class="level2">Training Instructor</h4>

<p class="level3">The Training Instructor can either be a permanent position, 
  or one which is filled on a rotating basis by front-line Ghostbusters looking
  for a little time away from regular operations.</p>

<p class="level3">The training instructor's job is, of course, to instruct the
  future ghostbuster in the skills they will need to be an effective buster of 
  ghosts. This is done through a combination of traditional instruction, 
  practical demonstrations, realistic simulations, and hands-on experience.</p>
  
<p class="level3">Obviously, then, a good instructor is absolutely essential
  to the success of any program. Ideally, an instructor should combine the Cool 
  of Peter Venkman, the Brains of Egon Spengler and Ray Stanz, and the Muscles
  and Moves of Winston Zeddemore. (An ability to manifest the chutzpah of 
  Jeanine Melnitz would certainly be a great asset as well!)</p>
 
<h4 class="level2">Janitor</h4>
 
<p class="level3">A janitor is a necessary (and well-paid!) member of the staff.
  From Slime-covered uniforms, to strange glowing liquids tracked in on the 
  floors, a good janitor can handle it all.  While they are not out there 
  slinging plasma streams and throwing traps, you'd be surprised at the amount 
  of information can be picked up while operating on the background.</p>

<p class="level3">Don't let the job title fool you, though. While their primary
  job is maintaining a professionally clean workplace, the janitor can also be
  counted on to carry out routine maintenance and repair of equipment or to lend
  a hand to help complete construction of the latest gizmo or whizbang to come
  out of an eager student's mind. A good Jack-of-all-trades makes an invaluable
  janitor.</p>

<h3 class="level1">Secondary Positions</h3>

<h4 class="level2">Nurse</h4>

<p class="level3">One thing can be counted on once students go out into the 
  field: people will get hurt. Having a good nurse on staff is an excellent
  way to offset the hazards of the job.</p>

<h4 class="level2">Receptionist</h4>

<p class="level3">Once a Training Center gets up an running, everyone is likely 
  to be too busy with other duties to always have someone near a phone. Many 
  people think of a receptionist as simply decorative, or a status symbol. They 
  are wrong.</p>
  
<p class="level3">Angry public Officials, desperate clients, pushy government
  agencies, you don't want an answering machine to be the voice they hear. A
  good receptionist can turn even the toughest, most irate callers into 
  reasonable people with whom you can actually converse.</p>

<h4 class="level2">Counselor</h4>

<p class="level3">The Counselor divides their time between providing academic 
  guidance, as well as well as more traditional couselling. Sometimes, a 
  trainee's first exposure to the supernatural reveals they weren't as ready as 
  they thought they were.  Sometimes the pressure to excel seems too
  much to bear.</p>
  
<p class="level3">The academic guidance provided by the Counselor starts by 
  interviewing and evaluating prospective students, assigning remedial training 
  (if needed), periodically evaluating progress and finally, assisting newly-
  minted Ghostbusters with finding a place in the ever-growing Ghostbuster
  Franchise Network.</p>

<h4 class="level2">Assistant Director</h4>

<p class="level3">Many might consider having an Assistant Director to be a top 
  priority, but in reality, until a Training Center reaches a certain size
  and activity level, there really isn't much need for one.</p>
  
<p class="level3">The Asisstant Director is officially the second in command
  of the center, and winds up splitting the day-to-day duties of management with
  the Director as they see fit.  This person can be, but often is not, a
  former Ghostbuster, their experience often lies more in administration. This 
  sometimes makes the Director/Assistant Director relationship slightly 
  adversarial.</p>

<h4 class="level2">HR Coordinator</h4>

<p class="level3">Now that a staff has grown this large, the hiring of new staff
  is best handed over to a specialist.  In some locations an HR Coordinator 
  operates as an adevisor to the Director, who still makes the final decisions. 
  In others, they handle all of the hiring themselves. </p>

<h4 class="level2">Paralegal</h4>

<p class="level3">Ghostbusting and Legal Issues go together like cats and dogs.
  Many franchises feel that if they aren't currently in the middle os <i>some
  </i> sort of legal action, they aren't trying hard enough. Regardless, if
  actual Ghostbusters often find themselves in legal trouble, what about a bunch
  os <i>student</i> ghostbusters?  A good paralegal helps a school keep on top
  of these things. They are either a direct hire, or a designee from the 
  school's retained law firm.</p>

<h4 class="level2">PR Representative</h4>

<p class="level3">Media outlets love to focus on negativity. That's not really 
  their fault, all you have to do is look at people slowing down to look at a 
  car wreck to know that love Bad News.  Given that, it takes a good and 
  dedicated person to counter the negative spin which seems to automatically be 
  applied to Ghosbusting incidents by shifting attention away from unimportant 
  things like property damage or the destruction of vital civic infrastructure 
  to what is really important; the busting ghosts!</p>

<h4 class="level2">Recruitment Coordinator</h4>

<p class="level3"></p>

<h4 class="level2">Civic Liason</h4>

<p class="level3">Where the PR Coordinator is the voice of the Training Center
  to the masses, the Civic Liason is the calm voice of reason to the various
  government agencies who inevitably find themselves for one reason or another
  at odds with the Training Center; either as a whole or with its various staff 
  and students in part.  They quite pften find themselves coordinating team 
  effforts with the paralegal and PR Representative.</p>

<h4 class="level2">Safety/Security Officer</h4>

<p class="level3">While you would think someone would have to be incredibly 
  foolhardy, stupid, or insane to try and cause trouble in a place housing a
  Ghost Containment Unit, the potential resale value of all the high-tech
  weaponry is sometimes to tempting to resist. But in addition to protecting
  the facility from external threats, the Security and Safety Officer is also
  trained to be the first responder to internal threats as well, they handle
  everything from irate visitors to Containment Breaches.</p>

<h3 class="level1">Tertiary Positions</h3>

<h4 class="level2">Teaching Assistant</h4>

<p class="level3">Sometimes it happens that a Trainee is unable to meet the 
  @Graduation Requirements, usually the financial ones.  In those cases, they
  become Teaching Assistants, which is a glorified term for "permanent student"
  these ghostbusters-in-all-but-name often assume the role of backup for the 
  current cohort of students, or manning communications in the Ectobus. They 
  also fill the role of tutor for any remedial studies needed by the students.
