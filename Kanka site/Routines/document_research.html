<h4><b>This comes up a lot, and it's kinda dull to just say
"you find what you're looking for" or "tough- no dice"
all the time. Use this routine when the Ghostbusters
have ample time for extensive research. If they're
looking for official documents as opposed to Gbostology-
type research, you may have to alter some of the
outcomes a little.</b></h4>

<br>

<h2 class="level1"><i>SECTION A</i></h2>

<ol class="level2">
  <li>You find the resources you believe you'll need.</li>
  <li>You make up a list of the materials you need, and start looking for them.
    Make A Good Amount of difficulty Brains roll.<br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b>You find the place that has most of the things you're 
        looking for.</li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b>You can't locate any of the resources you need. Roll again
        on 'A,' adding one to the roll.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>There is one particular book you're sure you need but you lent it to a 
    friend about eight months ago. Make A Good Amount of difficulty Cool roll.
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b>You call your friend and get the book back in exchange
        for returning the friend's hedge clippers(or whatever's appropriate).
        </li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b>You and your friend have some harsh words. You'll just
        have to do without the book - increase the difficulty of all 
        success/failure rolls in section 'B' by one level.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>You go to the library and find a huge stack of books all of which may have
    something Important in them. Make A Good Amount of difficulty Muscles roll.
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b>You carry them all to your table.</li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b>You get a hernia trying to pick them all up. Go to the 
        hospital routine.
    </ul></li>
  <li>You begin looking for the books you need. One is in the private collection
    of a famous rival occultist. Make a Lots of diffi~~ulty Cool roll.<br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b>You talk him into letting you look at the book for ten
        minutes. Make a Lots of difficulty Brains roll<br>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Success:</b>No positive effect, but no negative effect either.
            </li>
          <li><b>Failure:</b>Increase the difficulty of all success/failure
            rolls in the rest of the routine by one level.</li>
        </ul></li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b>He out-bargains you, and you end up paying $2000 for 
        the privilege of looking at the book.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>The only place you can find a copy of one of the works you're sure you'll
    need is in a little occult book shop in the seedy section of downtown. You 
    greet the creepy owner and ask for the book. Make Some difficulty Brains and
    Moves rolls.<br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b>You notice something very odd about him - and when he
        incants a spell in your direction, you're ready to Dodge the strange 
        orange bolt. Under threat of physical death, the little man gives you 
        what you want.</li>
      <li><b>Failure (one or both):</b>The Little demon-worshipper cackles with
        glee as you succumb to his spell. "If you're interested in the 'Sundry 
        Horrors' book, you can't be all good!" The next thing you know you're 
        out on the street with the book you needed. But what happened in there 
        ... ?</li>
    </ul></li>
</ol>

<br>

<h2 class="level1"><i>SECTION B</i></h2>

<ol class="level2">
  <li>You look through your chosen material and write down much pertinent 
    information.</li>
  <li>You comb through many boring accounts of... of ... *zzzz*. Make A Good 
    Amount of difficulty Muscles roll.<br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b>You manage to stay awake to get to the really juicy 
        stuff.</li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b>The words begin to blur together and nothing makes 
        sense. You pass over an important piece of information. Add one to the 
        roll for section 'C.'</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Several accounts seem pertinent to your quest, but they're at odds with
    each other and make no sense. Make A Good Amount of difficulty Brains roll.
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b>You realize that in one account, a name has been used 
        symbolically rather than logically. You're ready to proceed, but it took
        extra time.</li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b>You decide the whole thing is a wild goose chase and 
        move on to the next source. Increase the difficulty of success/failure
        rolls in section 'C' by one level.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>You have a tremendous amount of material to cover, so you hire extra help
    to do index work. Pay $3500. In addition, you know that 1f you wanted the 
    job done right, you should have done it yourself. Add one to your roll for 
    section 'C.'</li>
  <li>You begin to put together a pattern of information - but one key piece 
    appears to be missmg. Make a Lots of difficulty Cool roll.<br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b>You persevere, and after extra days of frustrating 
        search, find the missing piece.</li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b>You decide that the information you want is in another
        source, and leave off your research to find it. It is unavailable, and 
        when you go back to what you were doing, you cannot recall the details.
        Add one to your die roll for section 'C,' and increase the difficulty of
        the success/failure rolls by one level.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>In order to get the information you need, you must pronounce, out loud, 
    something which purports to be a spell of disaster. The sweat trickles into 
    your mouth as you begin reading. Make a Lots of difficulty Cool roll.<br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b>You speak the spell with nary a slip. A demon appears
        and gives you the information you need. However, you feel that you have
        created a rift in the eka-dimensional structure, and he could pop up 
        again at inopportune times.</li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b>Disaster! City blocks are shaken to their very 
        foundation when you say "weather" instead of "whether." Lawsuits begin 
        to trickle in almost immediately. End the routine.</li>
    </ul></li>
</ol>

<br>

<h2 class="level1"><i>SECTION C</i></h2>

<ol class="level2">
  <li>You get all the details possible to help you in your adventure.</li>
  <li>You get almost all the details possible, but a few minor pieces are 
    missing - specific dates, ancestors, etc.</li>
  <li>You have a mass of data, but it makes no sense. Make a Lots of difficulty
    Brains or Cool roll.<br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b>You either use a computer or get a friend to do so, and
        a pattern emerges. It's not everything, but the key information is 
        there.</li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b>It's a hopeless muddle. You've got a lot of facts, but
        no pattern.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Everything fits except for one contradictory piece of data. Make a Lots of
    difficulty Brains roll.<br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b>You go back and determine which piece must not fit. You
        have a broad outline of all the right answers.</li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b>You cannot figure out what's right and what's not. You
        have a broad outline of the problem, with one key fact incorrect.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Once all the information is gathered, a single name appears to be very 
    important. You pronounce this name out loud - and a physical manifestation 
    of a Sumo wrestler appears and challenges you! Make a Lots of difficulty 
    Muscles roll.<br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b>You defeat the wrestler at his own game! He fills you 
        in with sketchy details about the information you seek.</li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b>You don't even know the rules! After your defeat, the 
        wrestler takes only your clothes and a few valuable possessions before 
        vanishing in a puff of smoke. All your research is gone.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>Names and places begin to fall together - but unbeknownst to you, they're
    the wrong names and places. Your information is pretty much wrong down the 
    line, but you think you've got all the answers.</li>
