<h4><b>Use this when the Ghostbusters are suing someone for failure to pay ... 
  or more likely, when the Ghostbusters are being sued for some terrible 
  destruction of property. Also good for getting those hotheaded Ghostbusters 
  out on bail.</b></h4>

<br>

<h2 class="level1"><i>SECTION A</i></h2>

<ol class="level2">
  <li>You arrange for a cheap legal-aid lawyer to represent you.</li>
  <li>You decide to represent yourself, and bone up on legal books in library.
    Make a Lots of difficulty Brains roll.</li>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b>You find proper precedents and are prepared with a 
        sound line of reasoning.</li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b>You choose a ludicrous line of defense. Increase the 
        difficulty of all success/failure rolls in sections 'B' and 'C' by one 
        level.</li>
    
    </ul>
  
  <li>You know a lawyer. He recommends a settlement out of court; you call the 
    other principle in the case. Make A Good Amount of difficulty Cool roll.
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b>You agree to a quick compromise, and end up owing about
        $300 in court fees. The routine is over.</li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b>You. get so mad in your conversation that nothing can 
        stop you from going to court! Your foul phone language adds obscenity 
        charges into the case.</li>
    
    </ul>
  
  <li>You want a lawyer. On the recommendation of a friend you make an 
    appointment with the senior partner at Bossy, Mossy, Martin and Fuss. She 
    listens attentively, and seems like the perfect lawyer for you! Make A Good
    Amount of difficulty Brains roll.</li>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b>You realize that the books on the shelf are al1 about 
        fabulously overpriced and drawn-out cases. You look elsewhere. Roll 
        again (if you get this result, you find an okay lawyer and go to 'B').
        </li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b>You hire her, not realizing that the firm is overpriced
        and understaffed. Double all fees and halve all rewards received in 
        section 'C.'</li>
    
    </ul>
  
  <li>You need a lawyer. On the recommendation of a friend you make an 
    appointment with the firm of Nasty, Dull, Brutish, and Short. They listen 
    attentively and seem like the perfect lawyers for you! Make a Lots of 
    difficulty Brains roll.</li>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b>You notice that as they listen they doodle dollar signs
        and the word "Tahiti" on their legal pads. You gracefully make your exit
        - roll again (if you roll this result again, you find a lawyer and go to
        'B').</li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b>You hire them, not realizing they are crooked through 
        and through. You get no rewards and pay double fees in section 'C.'</li>
    
    </ul>
  
  <li>You get Clarence Narrow, famous trial lawyer, to defend you for free! 
    However, you get the sinking feeling that he'll call on you for a favor 
    sometime. Probably a really big favor.</li>
  
</ol>
<br>

<h2 class="level1"><i>SECTION B</i></h2>

<ol class="level2">
  <li>The trial begins without a hitch .</li>
  <li>The morning of the trial you grab a hot dog and a cup of coffee. Make A
    Good Amount of difficulty Moves roll.</li>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b>You make it through the commuter jam without staining
        your new suit.</li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b>You spend the rest ofthe day looking like an idiot, 
        trying to hide the mustard stains as you testify. Increase the 
        difficulty of all success/failure rolls in section 'C' by one level.</li>
    </ul>
  
  <li>If you have a lawyer, make a 4-die Some difficulty Brains roll. If you 
    don't, use your own Brains in a Lots of difficulty roll.</li>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b>Halve any penalties against you.</li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b>Double any penalties against you.</li>
    
    </ul>
  
  <li>The bailiff and judge confer for several minutes; the judge calls you and
    your lawyer for a quick conference. It turns out that someone forgot to fill
    out an important form, and by mistake a court form from another case was 
    inserted. The judge throws up his hands - procedure cannot be violated 
    without creating sure grounds for appeal. The trial is postponed - roll 
    again on 'B,' adding one to the result.</li>
  <li>A fight breaks out in the courtroom as a weirdly dressed spectator leaps 
    up shouting that Ghostbusters are in league with the devil. You make an 
    impromptu speech and A Good Amount of difficuJty Cool roll.</li>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b> You point out the prejudice to which you are 
        subjected, and the jury takes pity. Lower the difficulty of 
        success/failure rolls in section 'C' by one level.</li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b>Your lawyer (or friends) try frantically to shush you 
        as you blast your enemies and come off sounding like a satanworshipper.
        You lose the trial and pay $5000 times the amount by which you missed 
        the roll (maximum of $100,000).</li>
    
    </ul>
  
  <li>Of your eight character witnesses, one is having a baby, three get into 
    traffic accidents, three are ill, and one has been hijacked to Iceland. You 
    hurriedly round up your garbage man and the girl who sold you Scout Cookies.
    Make A Good Amount of difficulty Cool and Moves rolls.</li>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Succeed at both:</b>You get them both to the trial and their 
        testimony is considered!</li>
      <li><b>Fail at one but not the other:</b> You get one to the trial, but 
        get a speeding ticket trying to hunt down the other. Pay a $500 fine and
        lose your license for two months.</li>
      <li><b>Fail both:</b>You make a complete fool of yourself and lose the 
        trial. Add up the amounts missed by and pay $5000 per point, maximum 
        $150,000.</li>
    
    </ul>
  
</ol>

<br>

<h2 class="level1"><i>SECTION C</i></h2>

<ol class="level2">
  <li>The evidence is clearly in your favor and you win a modest settlement of
    $1000.</li>
  <li>As the trial proceeds, the judge and jury become more and more charmed by 
    your irrepressible good humor and pluck. By the end of the trial, they hiss
    at the opposing lawyers and smile dotingly at you. Roll your Cool and 
    multiply the total of the dice by $3000. That's how much money you win (you 
    may not spend Brownie Points).</li>
  <li>The opposing lawyers, attempting to strike at the very foundation of your
    credibility, challenge you to produce a ghost in court. Unfortunately, you 
    only have quick access to a nasty slimer (Ectopresence and Power of 2). It 
    escapes and slimes innocent bystanders. You have four rounds to stop it, or 
    it slimes the judge and you lose the case big-time. If you stop the ghost,
    roll again on ' C' and add one to the result. If you get this result again,
    treat it as a '4'.</li>
  <li>The trial turns into an historic event, with the opposition and your side 
    arguing much legal mumbo-jumbo ("The Ghostbusters have callously 
    encapsulated insubstantial entities and despoiled the metaphysical 
    environment," "These ghosts have all been declared legally dead and are 
    therefore without status ... "). Add your Brains and Cool together (and add 
    four more if you have a lawyer) and make a More Difficulty Than You Can 
    Imagine roll.</li>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b>You win the day and earn a $800,000 cash award.</li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b>You lose the day and earn a $800,000 cash penalty.</li>
    
    </ul>
  
  <li>You realize that you haven't a prayer of actually winning this case. Make
    a Lots of difficulty Brains roll.</li>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b>You fire your lawyers and concentrate on media 
        attention. Your appearance on Letterman - and the cash advance for your
        novel - neatly cancels your huge legal loss.</li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b>You were right. You are fined $100,000.</li>
    
    </ul>
  
  <li>Just as things look their bleakest, the Mayor arrives and testifies on 
    your behalf. And then the Chief of Police comes. And then the Cardinal. And
    ... everyone is dazzled (including you). The witnesses each mention as they
    leave that they have a little job for you - but don't worry, it won't take 
    too long. You win the suit, but your mind reels.</li>
