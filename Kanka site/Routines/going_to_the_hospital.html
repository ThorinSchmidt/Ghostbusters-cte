<h4><b>Most of the time, you can just heal somebody up a stat point per day and 
  be done with it. But for solo adventuring or when you feel that the expense of
  the hospital stay is not enough punishment, run the star through the wringer 
  -  er, that is, the hospital routine. You'll be glad you did.<br>
  <br>
  Ghostbusters in Training have the option to see the Staff Nurse (if avaiable)
  first. Seeing the Nurse has a base cost of $200, but reduces the roll result
  for each section by 1.</b></h4>

<br>

<h2 class="level1"><i>SECTION A</i></h2>

<ol class="level2">
  <li>You are admitted and shown to a private room.</li>
  <li>While waiting for admission, you notice a man covered with a sticky goo 
    being admitted. Make a Good Amount of difficulty Brains roll.<br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b> You question him while he's waiting, and find out he's
        had a run-in with a slimer ghost. A possible client when you get out!
        </li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b> It looks like he fell into a tub of pink corn syrup. 
        How disgusting.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>You are left waiting in the admitting room for many hours. Make Some 
    difficulty Muscles and Cool rolls.<br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Succeed Both:</b> You wait patiently (and stoically) until 
        admission.</li>
      <li><b>Fail Muscles:</b> You lose an additional two points off your stats
        before you're admitted.</li>
      <li><b>Fail Cool:</b> You lose your temper and go berserk. You end up in 
        the county jail medical facility - but at least you're being taken care
        of. End routine.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>You are asked to fill out a rather lengthy form before you can be 
    admitted. One of the requests is for your birth certificate number, which 
    you don't have. Another Ghostbuster must run through the "Obtaining a 
    Permit" routine before you can be admitted.</li>
  <li>As you are being admitted, the nurse keeps calling you "Miss Jones" and 
    commenting on what a brave thing you're doing. Make a Lots of difficulty 
    Cool roll.<br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b> You convince her to check the records, and narrowly 
        avoid getting vital parts snipped off by accident.</li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b> You are so flummoxed by this that you don't protest when 
        they wheel you into the delivery room. It takes them a while to realize 
        that you're not pregnant. (Male Ghostbusters - there's a really cute 
        nurse in pediatrics.) Things get straightened out, but you can't start 
        healing for two days.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>After admitting you, men appear and load you on an ambulance and take you 
    to another, nearby hospital. Roll again on 'A.' If you get this result, 
    you're okay.</li>
</ol>

<br>

<h2 class="level1"><i>SECTION B</i></h2>

<ol class="level2">
  <li>Your stay is pleasant, and you heal nicely.</li>
  <li>Your stay is pleasant, but none of your friends come to visit and you get
    depressed. Make a Good Amount of difficulty Cool roll.<br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b> You don't mind - the rest is good for you.</li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b> You're hurt. Skip one day of healing, and think 
        seriously about the kind of people you associate with.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>They have you on somebody else's schedule maybe several somebodies. The 
    night nurse wakes you up constantly to take a variety of pills. Make a Lots
    of difficulty Muscles roll.<br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b> You manage to heal anyway (but skip one day of 
        healing) and make a good friend of the night nurse.</li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b> You are not making any progress. Roll again on 'B,' 
        and add one to the roll. If you get this result again, you're okay.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>You and the head nurse have a personality conflict. You can tell there's
    going to be trouble. Increase the difficulty of success/failure rolls in
    section 'C' by one level.</li>
  <li>The treatment you're receiving is lax, and the food is awful, and you're
    stuck in a room with someone who groans all night. Make A Good Amount of 
    difficulty Brains roll.<br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b> You threaten various lawsuits and other retribution. 
        Still, the hospital is overcrowded and the care you receive is not the 
        best. Heal one point for each two days you stay.</li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b> It only gets worse. Heal one point for each week you 
        stay.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>In the middle of the night, a beep comes from the PKE meter you snuck in 
    with you. Following the trail, you come upon a bunch of interns summoning 
    ghosts from those bodies in the morgue. Go to another hospital (start over 
    at 'A').
</ol>

<br>

<h2 class="level1"><i>SECTION C</i></h2>

<ol class="level2">
  <li>You're discharged without incident. Your stay cost the base amount per 
    day.</li>
  <li>There's a minor holdup at the discharge desk. You'll have to resubmit to 
    Blue Cross and pay double the base amount per day up front (go through 
    "Obtaining a Permit" to recover half of this money).</li>
  <li>At the discharge desk, they give you a hard time about the candy bars and 
    the PKE meter you smuggled in. Make a Lots of difficulty Cool roll.<br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b> You charm them and pay 1.25 the base amount per day of
        your stay.</li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b> You get belligerent. Your bill comes to 2.5 the base 
        amount per day of your stay.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>On your last day, you contract a strange disease and lose three stat 
    points. You can be discharged anyway, if you want. If not, roll again on 'C'
    but subtract one from the roll. Add the extra days to your base cost.</li>
  <li>Due to a clerical error, you're being charged for private accommodations 
    with all the trimmings, even though you were not in a private room. Make a 
    Lots of difficulty Brains roll.<br>
    If you actually <i>were</i> in a private room, they are still charging you 
    for things you didn't have. Make a Good Amount of difficulty Brains roll.
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b> You find the error and the problem is corrected. Pay 
        the base amount per day.</li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b> You can't convince them of the error. Pay 5 times the
        base amount per day. If you want any money back, you'll have to take 'em
        to court.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>On your way to the discharge area, an emergency team grabs you, sedates 
    you, and when you wake up you're short an appendix. Pay the base amount per
    day plus $10,500 for the operation. If you want any back, you'll have to go
    to court.</li>
