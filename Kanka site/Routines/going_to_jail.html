<h2 class="level1"><i>SECTION A</i></h2>

<ol class="level2">
  <li>The cop doing your booking is sympathetic and everything goes smoothly.
    you are given a quiet cell with a view of the staff TV.</li>
  <li>You are booked efficiently, and put into the overnight "drunk tank".</li>
  <li>Your booking officer seems stressed from overwork. Make a Good Amount of
    difficulty Cool roll<br>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Success:</b> You manage to say the right things to put the officer
        in a better frame of mind. They let you steal a doughnut to eat on the 
        way to the cells since you just missed mealtime.</li>
      <li><b>Failure:</b> Your attempts at humor and distraction do nothing but
        irritate the officer further.  They escort you to the dirtiest cell, and
        iform you that you just missed the last mealtime, but they'll "see what
        they can do" to get you something before breakfast tomorrow.</li>
    </ul></li>
  <li>The precinct seems understaffed, and you have apparently been confused 
    with another person, as a burly sergeant calls out your name, and you watch,
    dumbfounded as another person is hauled to their feet and told that "It was
    all a misunderstanding," and that "they are free to go."</li>
  <li>The holding cells at this preconct are full.  You are tranported to 
    another precinct in a more dangerous part of town. Roll again on 'A,' and
    add one to the roll. If you get this result again, you are booked here, but 
    add one to your roll on 'B.'</li>
