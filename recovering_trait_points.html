<h2 class="level1">My Ghostbuster lost Trait Points. What now?</h2>

<p class="level2">Losing Trait points is a fairly big deal, although it is 
  better than dying. The first thing though, is to look at <i>why</i> you lost
  Trait points. Any points lost because you exchanged them for Brownie points
  are gone, gone, gone. There <i>is</i> a way to get those back, but involves
  spending Brownie Points to do it, which is detailed in the Brownie points
  section. This section deals with temporary Trait point losses due to damage
  your Ghostbuster sustained during an adventure</p>
  
<h3 class="level2">Regular Bed Rest</h3>
  
<div class="level3">
  <p>This is the simplest, least expensive method. Your 
    Ghostbuster goes home, goes to bed (or couch, we don't judge) and pretty 
    much stays there.  This is a great option if you have caring friends who 
    will bring you food, you have a mom/grandma with a large supply of 
    chicken soup, or there is a handy pizza place that delivers.</p>
    
  <p>For each day you spend resting at home, <i>doing nothing else</i>(except 
    watching TV or light reading), roll a Ghost Die. If the result is a Ghost,
    your day of rest was unsucessful (your friends come over and convince you
    to Monopoly, your Aunt/Uncle comes over to "help you recuperate", etc.). 
    Otherwise, on a result of 1-5, congratulations! You just regained 1 Trait 
    point! What? Yes, only 1.  I said this was the simplest and cheapest 
    option, not the most effective.</p>
    
</div>

<h3 class="level2">ER/Urgent Care Visit</h3>
  
<div class="level3">
  <p>This is an option if the damage is bad, but not <i>too</i> bad. It can be 
    dicey, however.  First roll a Ghost Die, if you roll a Ghost, the facility
    is swamped, and they just can't handle another patient. Either go home, or 
    go to the Hospital. On a roll of 1-5, they can see you! In that many hours.
    </p>
  
  <p>Once you are in with the doctor/nurse, roll another Ghost Die(told ya this 
    was dicey!). If a Ghost is rolled, you are too complicated, and they send
    you to the Hospital(Bed Rest at home is no longer a viable option!). On a 
    roll of 1-5, you gain back that many Trait Points(up to your max)! Huzzah!
    If that does not heal you fully, you can then go home and recover the rest
    in bed, or go to the hospital for more help. You cannot choose this option
    until after you have managed to regain all your Trait points at least once.
    </p>
  
  <p>This option is more expensive than resting at home, but cheaper than the 
    Hospital.  The actual costs are left to your GM, but a recommended ballpark
    cost is $2,500 per Trait point recovered. Plus any ambulance fees, if any.
    Note that if you are transferred to the hospital, there <i>will</i> be 
    ambulance fees. Wait, what if you went to an ER? Sorry, the only available 
    bed is at another hospital.</p>
    
</div>

<h3 class="level2">Hospital Stay</h3>
  
<div class="level3">
  <p>A hospital stay is the most effective and most expensive recovery method.
    Any Non-USA readers, please note, I'm exaggerating things a bit for comedy,
    but <i>not by much</i>!</p>
    
  <p>A visit to the hospital always takes a minimum of three days. Roll 3d6
    (1 Ghost Die, 2 regular dice). You recover that many Trait points up to your
    max. Keep track of the total amount rolled. If you didn't recover all your 
    points, then you must stay another day until fully healed. The hospital will
    not dischargr you until then. For each additional day, roll the Ghost Die,
    and add that amount to the previous total. If at any time a Ghost is rolled,
    you only recieve <i>half</i> the total amount rolled. Round fractions up, 
    minimum of 1.</p>
    
  <p>The cost for your stay is a little complex.  The actual cost per point is
    ultimately up to the Ghostmaster, but it is normally twice the cost of the
    ER rate.  In this case, $5,000 per point <i>rolled</i>. Yes, the amount you
    rolled, not the amount you healed. In addition, if at any time a Ghost was 
    rolled, multiply the final cost(including ambulance and ER fees, if any)
    by 1.5.</p>
    
  <p>For instance, Beverly lost a total of 6 trait points dealing with a 
    Carnivorous Ice Cream Truck.  She goes to the ER, and is seen. BBeverly's 
    player then rolls a Ghost, and is sent to the hospital (minimum ER fee plus 
    ambulance ride) Once in the hospital, her player rolls a 4, 4, and a Ghost.
    Normally, Beverly would recover 8 Trait points, but the Ghost makes it 4.
    Beverly stays another day. For next day, Beverly's player rolls a 5! yay!
    She is discharged from the hospital and receives a bill for $102,750. And 
    no, I am <i>not</i> exagerrating all that much!</p>
  
  <p>It breaks down like this:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>$ 2,500 - Minimum ER fee</li>
    
    <li>$ 1,000 - Ambulance fee</li>
    
    <li>$65,000 - hospital stay  13 points rolled x 5000 each.<br>
      --------------------------------------------------------------</li>
    
    <li>$68,500 - Normal cost</li>
    
    <li>1.5 multiplier (rolled a Ghost. 2, actually.)</li>
    
    <li><b>$102,750</b> - Final cost due to "Complications"</li>
    
  </ul>

  <p>The actual nature of the complications is left to the fertile mind of the
    Ghostmaster. Msybe surgery was required, or extra tests, maybe a ghost 
    invaded the hospital (in which case some horse-trading ahould reduce the 
    bill, assuming the Ghostbusters handle it with little collateral damage).
