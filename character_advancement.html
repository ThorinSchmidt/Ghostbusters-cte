<h2 class="level1">Graduation Requirements</h2>

<p class="level2">There is a player document that discusses the in-game "graduation 
  requirements" but here we detail the ways to fulfill those requirements in 
  terms of game mechanics.</p>

<h3 class="level2">Trait increase</h3>

<div class="level3">
  <p>In the @Student_Handbook it states that in order to graduate,
    the Trainee must "demonstrate their dedication to Ghostbusting through 
    rigorous training and demonstrate an example of exceeding their current 
    limitations." In other words, they need to advance at least one Trait by at 
    least one point, bringing their total to at least 13.  So, recovery of a 
    "burned" Trait point is not sufficent.</p>

  <p>Increasing a Trait point is fairly straightforward.  As soon as A character 
    accumulates the 30 Brownie Points required, a player may spend them on any
    Trait they wish, subject to GM approval. All this means is that you, the GM
    agree that it makes sense for that Trait to increase.</p>
    
  <p>In order for that to happen, the player and GM should discuss which Trait 
    they would like tp increase first, and then purposefully "work in" times 
    when the ghostbuster does things to try and improve. An easy way to do this 
    is by keeping a running total of successes when using that Trait(not 
    talent! they are trying to exceed <i>current</i> limitation), and adding the 
    level of siuccess to it. Then, once the total reaches 30(or whatever), they
    then "qualify" to raise that Trait by one point.</p>
    
  <p>For instance, Sean is currently a chemist, and has Brains 4 and Muscles 2.
    Sean's player decides having a Muscles of 3 would msake him a better 
    Ghostbuster. You as the GM agree, and you begin keeping track of Sean's 
    Muscles successes.  Every time Sean uses his Muscles to solve a problem and 
    suceeds, look at the UHM table and see what the level of success is. Then,
    using that level, check out the "damage" column, and add that number to the
    running total. I suppose if you want to be mean, you could allow failures to
    <i>reduce</i> the total in the same way, but you didn't hear that from me! 
    Oh, by the way, using Brownie Points to add dice to these rolls is totally 
    fine!</p>

</div>
    
<h4 class="level3">What about the Power Trait?</h4>

<div class="level4">
  <p>Yes. The Power Trait.  Well, there are two scenarios to consider here:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>The character does already have the Power Trait.</li>
    
    <li>The character does <i>not</i>already have the Power Trait.</li>
    
  </ol>
  
  <p>If the character already has points in their Power Trait, then increasing 
    it works like above, except that the running total must reach 60, and it 
    will cost 60 Brownie Points instead of 30. It's the same 2-for-1 cost as 
    with character creation.</p>
    
  <p>If the character does not have a Power Trait, things are a little 
    different. It will still cost 60 Brownie points, and require accumulating a
    running total of 60, but how can someone make Power rolls with no Power? by
    training, of course. The nature of this training is up to you and the 
    player, there are a variety of methods from movies, books and TV shows to 
    choose from.</p>

  <p>Maybe they study ancient tomes of magic(Brains), or seek to increase 
    control of their body by intense martial arts(Moves or Muscles), or tap into
    their "center" by meditation(Cool). You'd think that last one would be 
    Brains, but perhaps <i>you</i> should try willfully ignoring distractions 
    while you concentrate on nothing.</p>
    
  <p>Now, once you both have agreed on a method of training, a portion of game
    time should be devoted to having the character do it.  It doesn't have to be
    super involved, but <i>should</i> include making a Training roll versus a 
    Target score of 6. Browniw Points can be added, record the "damage" score 
    for the level of success in the running total. Once the total hits 60, and 
    the player spends 60 Brownie points, they add a Power of 1 and a Lesser 
    Ghostly Ability of their choice, subject to your approval.</p>

</div>
    
<h3 class="level2">Talent swap</h3>

<div class="level3">
  <p>A portion of every game session should include Remedial Training.  This 
    is when the trainees spend time in the classroom getting practice with any
    new gadgetry you've decided to introduce(See Typical Game Session in 
    @Running_a_Campaign), or working on gaining skills that will help them 
    become more effective ghostbusters.</p>
    
  <h4>The ISP</h4>

</div>

<div class="level4">

  <p> Each character is going to have an ISP(Individualized Study Program) to 
    guide them in aquiring new skills. No, you won't have to roleplay homework
    (unless you want to, I suppose).  Usually, each game session will contain a 
    short sequence where everyone makes their "Study Rolls" for making progress 
    towards their new skillset, and adds any advancement result to their running
    totals. Here's how it all works:</p>
    
  <h5>Step One: Create the ISP</h5>
  
</div>

<div class="level5">
  <p>Early on in the campaign(if not Session 0, then by Session 2 at the 
    latest), discuss with each player what skills will need to change in order
    for their character to become an effective Ghostbuster, and what they will
    need to change into.  For most characters, this will be all of them, but not
    always.</p>
    
  <p>For instance, A former Boxer would likely have a Muscles talent of 
    Boxing, and decide that it would be cool to punch ghosts(yes, this is a 
    thing that happens, see @Slimeweave_gloves). In that case, there would be no
    need to "retrain" that skill.  Incidentally, if a player wants to develop 
    Power by training for it as described above, it would be included on the ISP
    as well.</p>
  
  <p>Once a player has decided which talents need to be changed, and what order 
    they'd like to work on them, they can fill in the ISP section of their 
    Academic Progress form.</p>

</div>

<h5 class="level4">Step Two: The training session</h5>

<div class="level5">
  <p>The actual in-game training sessions involve more than just the ISP, but 
    that is detailed in the @Running_a_Campaign document. We'll just concentrate
    on the ISP here.</p>
    
  <p>Basically, during each training session, each player makes a Training roll
    using the dice pool from the related Trait, plus any Brownie Points they 
    wish to spend, against a Target score of 14.  As stated above, check the 
    level of succes, and add the appropriate "damage" amount to the running 
    total for the current talent on the ISP. Only one talent may be "studied" 
    at a time, and it is assumed the Trainee will work on them in the order
    specified by the ISP.</p>
  
  <p>There are some caveats, and special circumstances surrounding the ISP. One 
    of them is that a character who is recuperating is not allowed to train! 
    They are <i>supposed</i> to be resting!  At your discretion, GM, it is 
    conceivable that a character staying in the hispital could still train on 
    non-physical skills. They could even train for physical skills, given that
    there are physocal therapy sections in the hospital, but in a case like 
    that, the target number should probably be higher, like maybe 18-20.</p>
  
  <p>Another special rule activates if a player decides to abandon training 
    before it is complete to switch to a different talent.  Maybe the player 
    wants to take their character in a new direction, or finds that the talent 
    really doesn't fit their original concept. It happens, so it is possible.
    However, it is not without consequences. Switching to a different talent 
    means that <i>half(rounded up)</i> of the running total accumulated for that
    talent soi far is forfeit. This means switching early on is not really a big
    deal but gets "pricier" as time goes on.</p>
  
  <p>Related to this is the situation where a player decides to abandon their 
    current training to start a different one, in effect, changing the order. 
    Now, switching the order of skills that haven't been started yet can be
    switched up for free, or switched out for others, for that matter. However,
    if a player decides to abandon studying the current talent for anopther one,
    then again, half of the current running total is forfeit. The remaining 
    total is not lost, but it is <i>not</i> transferred to the new skill. That 
    one starts at zero like normal. When the player comes back to that abandoned
    talent, they will resume with the total that remains.</p>
