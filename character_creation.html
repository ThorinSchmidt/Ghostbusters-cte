<h2 style="margin-left:22.5pt;">Step One: Decide Why Your Character Is a Loser
  </h2>

<div style="margin-left:40.5pt;">
  <p>The premise of Ghostbusters: CTE is that your 
    character, for some reason, is unsatisfied with their current life or career,
    and hes decided to train to become a Ghostbuster.  Perhaps they are 
    unemployed, or maybe in a "dead-end" job.  On the other hand, maybe they are
    in a high-end, lucrative career, and just can't or won't handle the stres 
    anymore. So, in short, decide what type of life your character is 
    <i>leaving behind</i>.
  </p>
  <p>Next, decide what it is about Ghostbusting that appeals to your character.
    This can be almost anything really. The key is that it can't be too generic,
    nor can it be too specific. So, your GM will likely need to work with you in 
    order to "hit the sweet spot". This choice is actyually quite important, since
    one of the ways your character improves over time is by meeting this goal.
  </p>
  <p>For example, suppose your character desires Fame.  Every time they trend on
    social media, or acquire another 1000 followers, or wind up on local news, 
    they get extra Brownie Points to spend to improve their character. (More on 
    that later)
  </p>
</div>
  
<h2 style="margin-left:22.5pt;">Step Two: Fill In the Blanks</h2>
<div style="margin-left:40.5pt;">
  <p>Now that you have a character Goal, it's time to start fleshing out your 
    character.  The first stop is choosing Traits. A character has four general 
    Traits: <b>Brains</b>, <b>Muscles</b>,<b> Moves</b> and <b>Cool</b>. Tony 
    Stark has lots of Brains; Superman has Muscles; The Flash has Moves; Bugs 
    Bunny has Cool. Decide how your character measures up in these areas, 
    relatively. You have 12 points to be distributed among the Traits. Each of the four 
    must have at least one point, and no Trait can have more than four.
  </p>
  <p><b>But Wait, What About That Last Blank?</b></p>
  <p>There is, indeed, a fifth Trait: <b>Power</b>. If your GM approves, you can
    spend <b>two</b> of your 12 points here to give your character a Power of 
    <b>1</b>. The Power Trait represents your character's supernatural ability
    in the form of magic, psychic ability, heightened senses, or some even 
    weirder (but cool) source. The exact form is up to you (and you GM, of 
    course).
  </p>
</div>

<h2 style="margin-left:22.5pt;">Step Three: Refine Things With Talents</h2>
<div style="margin-left:40.5pt;">
  <p>For each Trait, which is a general descriptor of your character, you get to choose a related Talent that corresponds to it. Picking a Talent can be tricky, since it should be more specific than a Trait, but not so specific that it becomes useless, such as a Muscles talent of One-Hand Pushups. </p><p style="margin-left:40.5pt;"><b><u><i>Additionally these Talents should relate to your current non-Ghostbuster lifestyle.</i></u></b> You will have the opportunity to exchange these talents for a new one. </p><p style="margin-left:40.5pt;">Here are some by no means exhaustive lists of Talents.</p>

  <h4 style="margin-left:55px;">Power</h4>
  <p style="margin-left:80px; width 90%">Choose one Lesser Ability from the list in <a href="#" class="mention" data-name="Ghostly Taxonomy" data-mention="[note:2473903]">Ghostly Taxonomy</a>, and if your GM approves, add it to your sheet as your Power talent. Unlike the other talents though, your Power Trait and Power Talent are <u><i>equal</i></u>.</p>
</div>

<h2 style="margin-left:22.5pt;">Step Four: The Details</h2>
<p style="margin-left:55px;">Finally, you can fill out the rest of the sheet:</p>
<ul style="margin-left:55px;">
  <li>Name - This is your characters name in the game.</li>
  <li>Alias - This is actually <i>your</i> name. Mostly for GM purposes</li>
  <li>GIT# - Your GM will assign this to you. It's your school ID number, 
    basically</li>
  <li>BP Start - You start the game with 20 Brownie Points</li>
  <li>BP Spent - This should be zero, unless you made the GM <i>really mad</i>.
    </li>
  <li>BP Left - If you can do Basic Math, then you already know what to put 
    here.</li>
  <li>Equipment - Leave these blank for now.</li>
  <li>Notes - Put a few descriptive phrases here about your character, like 
    looks, or obvious mannerisms; distinctive things others notice right away. 
    You could also put interesting secret background stuff here; just make sure 
    your GM knows and approves.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style="margin-left:22.5pt;">Step Five: Bask In The Glow</h2>
<p style="margin-left:80px;">That's it! You're done! If you are first, you can 
  sit back with a smug expression and exchange witty banter with the GM, Roll 
  the Ghost Die a few times, grab some snacks to eat noisily, or find some other
  way to be an insufferable ass. Or, you could see if anyone is struggling and 
  help them brainstorm, or otherwise be a good team player. It\s your call.</p>
