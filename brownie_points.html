<h2 class="level1">What are they?</h2>

<quote class="level2">"Its very powerful stuff..." -- Winston Zeddemore</quote>

<p class="level2">Maybe you've played in some of those Other Games, where they 
  have cumbersome things like "hit points", "skill modifiers", "XP", and 
  "character levels."  Ugh, how inelegant and needlessly complex. In 
  Ghostbusters, we have Brownie Points that take the place of all those messy
  mechanics. They are, all at the same time, an indication of your character's
  overall health, a pool from which to draw extra dice to roll, a way to track
  your progress, and a way to eventually advance your character's  Traits and
  Talents.</p>
  
<h2 class="level2">Wow, that <i>is</i> a lot. How do they work?</h2>

<p class="level3">Excellent question.Here is an excellent (hopefully) answer.
  </p>
  
<h3 class="level3">Increase your chances of success</h3>

<p class="level4">By far the most common use of Brownie Points is to increase
  The likelihood that your character will suceed at what they are attempting to 
  do. It works like this:  for every Brownie Point "spent" a ghostbuster gets 
  one more d6 to add to the next roll.</p>

<p class="level4">As an example, say that a ghostbuster is 
  attempting to Slime a runaway jack-in-the-box.  It's pretty nimble, so the
  Ghostmaster assigns a target score of 16 (that's Lots pf difficulty on the UHM
  scale), which means that with their measly Moves score of 2, there is no way
  to hit it. So the ghostbuster's player decides to spend 3 Brownie Points, 
  enabling them to roll 5d6's (instead of 2) to try and hit the crazed 
  children's toy.</p>
  
<p class="level4">The player then increases the amount in the "BP Spent" field 
  by 3, which then reduces their "BP Available" by the same amount. If you did 
  not notice, let's spell out some other things. You can only add dice to a 
  single attempt, and you <i>must</i> do so <i>after</i> the GM tells you the 
  target number, and <i>before</i> you make your roll. You can't add dice 
  afterwards, nor can you use Brownie Points to "reroll" any dice.</p>
  
<p class="level4">You might be concerned about eventally running out of Brownie
  Points. It <i>can</i> happen, but is rare, since successfully completing a 
  "bust" susally means you get at least all of your spent Brownie Points back
  at the end.</p>
