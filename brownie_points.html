<h2 class="level1">What are they?</h2>

<div class="level2">
  <quote> "Its very powerful stuff..." -- Winston Zeddemore</quote>

  <p>Maybe you've played in some of those Other Games, where they 
    have cumbersome things like "hit points", "skill modifiers", "XP", and 
    "character levels."  Ugh, how inelegant and needlessly complex. In 
    Ghostbusters, we have Brownie Points that take the place of all those messy
    mechanics. They are, all at the same time, an indication of your character's
    overall health, a pool from which to draw extra dice to roll, a way to track
    your progress, and a way to eventually advance your character's  Traits and
    Talents.</p>
    
  <h2>Wow, that <i>is</i> a lot. How do they work?</h2>

</div><!-- Level 2 -->

<div class="level3">
  <p>Excellent question.Here is an excellent (hopefully) answer.</p>
    
  <h3>Increase your chances of success</h3>

</div> <!-- Level 3 -->

<div class="level4">
  <p>By far the most common use of Brownie Points is to increase
    The likelihood that your character will suceed at what they are attempting to 
    do. It works like this:  for every Brownie Point "spent" a ghostbuster gets 
    one more d6 to add to the next roll.</p>

  <p>As an example, say that a ghostbuster is 
    attempting to Slime a runaway jack-in-the-box.  It's pretty nimble, so the
    Ghostmaster assigns a target score of 16 (that's Lots pf difficulty on the UHM
    scale), which means that with their measly Moves score of 2, there is no way
    to hit it. So the ghostbuster's player decides to spend 3 Brownie Points, 
    enabling them to roll 5d6's (instead of 2) to try and hit the crazed 
    children's toy.</p>

  <p>The player then increases the amount in the "BP Spent" field 
    by 3, which then reduces their "BP Available" by the same amount. If you did 
    not notice, let's spell out some other things. You can only add dice to a 
    single attempt, and you <i>must</i> do so <i>after</i> the GM tells you the 
    target number, and <i>before</i> you make your roll. You can't add dice 
    afterwards, nor can you use Brownie Points to "reroll" any dice.</p>

  <p>You might be concerned about eventally running out of Brownie
    Points. It <i>can</i> happen, but is rare, since successfully completing a 
    "bust" susally means you get at least all of your spent Brownie Points back
    at the end.</p>

</div> <!-- Level 4 -->
    
<div class="entrysidebarright">
  <p><b>BP Awards</b><br>
    After-mission awards always seem to cause confusion at first. Here's an
    example.</p>

  <p>After a mission, Ben and Jerry are recuperating back at the Training 
    Center(TC).  They successfully busted the ghost, but only barely. During 
    the mission Ben spent 5 Brownie Points.  Jerry spent 3.</p>

  <p>The GM thus awards Ben 5BP, and Jerry receives 3BP.  Yes. You read that 
    right.  Now, if Jerry would have spent 10BP, he would have<i>received</i>
    10BP. Go Big Or Go Home.</p>

  <p>Now, if Jerry <i>had</i> spent 10BP, he likely would have had better 
    levels of success, which might very well have led to a more successful
    completion.  In which case, the GM would then give Ben <i>8BP</i> and 
    Jerry would get a nice <i>15BP</i>.  Risk much, gain much.</p>

<h3 class="level3">Measure your character's progress</h3>

<div class="level4">
  <p>Now that we've talked about one of the most common ways to 
    <i>spend</i> Brownie Points, let's cover the most common way to <i>gain</i>
    Brownie Points. During a mission, you keep track of Spent Brownie Points
    in the "BP Spent" box.  At the conclusion of the mission (or sooner if The
    Ghostmaster wants to), your character gains a certain amount of Brownie 
    Points. Points are awarded based on the outcome of the mission as follows:
    </p>
    
  <ol>
    <li><b>You fail to get the ghost, or otherwise botch the job:</b> About 
      <i>half</i> the Brownie Points spent during the adventure will be refunded.
      </li>

    <li><b>You get the ghost or otherwise complete the job:</b> <i>All</i> your 
      spent Brownie Points are returned, perhaps even with one or two extra.</li>

    <li><b>You do an excellent job, save the day, and amuse the Ghostmaster:</b>
      <i>Up to half again</i> your spent Brownie Points are awarded at the end of
        the adventure.</li>

  </ol>
  
  <p>There are also a few more ways to earn extra Brownie Points:</p>
  
  <ol>
    <li><b>Achieve your Goal</b> - recall that your Goal should be specific but 
      not <i>too</i> specific? Achieving your Goal during the course of an 
      advewnture will result in the immediate award of 2-5 Brownie Points.</li>

    <li><b>Acting "in character"</b> - either through good roleplaying, or by
      deliberate actions that are in line with your character's nature and 
      dramatically move the story along, the GM will again immwdiately award 1-2
      Brownie Points.</li>

    <li><b>"Make the Ghostmaster laugh"</b> - don't take this literally. 
      Sometimes though, a player will do somethig that is inspired, insane, or 
      both and it will "tickle their fancy". Don't be surprised if this also 
      results in an immediate Brownie Point reward."</li>

<h3 class="level3">Keep your character out of the hospital</h3> 

<div class="level4">
  <p>Being a Ghostbuster is <i>dangerous</i>. At any time, disaster can strike,
    and your Ghostbuster could be harmed, or even killed.  Damage in this game, 
    is tracked by temporarily lowering Traits. Each level of damage results in
    one Trait being lowered by 1. The usual progression is this: Cool, Moves, 
    Muscles, Brains.  Your Ghostmaster might (and often will) change this up If
    it makes sense at the time.</p>
    
  <p>Gasp! How can you avoid such an awful fate?  By spending Brownie Pointrs of
    course!  Here's how it works: For every 2 Brownie Points you spend, you will
    reduce 1 level of damage and avoid losing a Trait point. There is a catch, 
    though.  You will need to describe what fantastical/improbable/ludicrous 
    thing that happened to save your Ghostbuster from their well-deserved fate. 
    Yup, you will have to Make Something Up. It's almost like the game designers
    wanted you to use your imagination or something.</p>
    
  <p>In case you are wondering, this spending is also recorded in the "Spent BP"
    box, and gets refunded at the end of the adventure as specified above. Also,
    yes, it makes spending BP on dice rolls a little more risky. There is also 
    something else to consider. Once a character reaches 0BP, that character is
    dead. well, <i>mostly</i> dead.  When a character hits 0BP, they can 
    permanently sacrifice a Trait point to gain 20 Brownie Points. Otherwise, 
    they are <i>actually</i> dead. So, it might sometimes be worth it to lose
    a Trait point temporarily.</p>

  <p>Incidentally, a character who loses all of their
    Trait points is completely incapatitated, and will need to recover in a 
    hospital. Recovering Trait points is covered elsewhere.</p>

</div> <!-- level 4 -->

<h3 class="level3">"Level up" your character</h3> 

<div class="level4">
  <p>There aren't any "character levels" in Ghostbusters:CTE. There are,
    however, ways to improve or "advance" your character. Specifacally, there
    are two, you can add 1 point to a specific Trait or you can choose to
    change a talent.  This second option is unique to Ghostbusters:CTE and
    is designed to reflect how your character changes skillsets as they move
    from their old occupation to being a Ghostuster.</p>
    
  <h4>Improving a Trait</h4>

</div> <!-- level 4 -->

<div class="level5">

  <p>Improving a Trait point is fairly simple.  By permanantly sacrificing 30
    Brownie Points, you can increase the value of one of your Traits (and by
    extension, its associated talent) by one. These 30 points do <i>not</i> get
    recorded in the "Spent BP" box. They are <i>gone</i>.  You may also have
    noticed that "burning" a Trait point only adds 20 Brownie Points to your
    character, while it would cost 30 to get that point back.</p>

</div> <!-- Level 5 -->

<h4 class="level4">Switching a Talent</h4>

<div class="level5">

  <p>Switching out your talents to ones that better match your new profession
    is part of what makes Ghostbusters:CTE unique, and the actual process is
    detailed in another section. As it pertains to your Brownie Points though,
    sacrificing 15 Brownie Points will allow you to change one of your talents
    to another one (subject to GM approval).  There's a little more to it, but 
    that's good enough for now.</p>

</div> <!-- Level 5 -->

<h2 class="level1">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p class="level3">There it is! How Brownie Points can make a difference in the
  daily life of a Ghostbuster! If you come across a situation that does not 
  appear to be covered by these guidelines, then let the Ghostmaster make a 
  ruling, note it, and move on.  Oh, also email the author so he can add it.</p>
