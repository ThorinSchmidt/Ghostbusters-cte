## Template for Kanka.io


These files are for creating a custom attribute tenplate for Kanka.io.

It uses the Ghostbusters RPG system by West End Games.
Their system uses pools of d6's and sliding difficulty
scales instead of the standard d20 SRD most are familiar with.

Currentlyu running into problems with css. one problem was 
from inheritance from the dark theme. all of my h tags were rendered in light font, 
and I need black, so I bypassed them with font classes.
