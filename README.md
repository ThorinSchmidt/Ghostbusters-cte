# Ghostbusters-CTE

## Template for Kanka.io

These files are for creating a custom attribute tenplate for Kanka.io.

It uses the Ghostbusters RPG system by West End Games.
Their system uses pools of d6's and sliding difficulty
scales instead of the standard d20 SRD most are familiar with.

===
## Changelog:
* version 1 was a very rough prototype
* version 2.0 first usable version.  It will become the baseline for the Ghost
and NPC templates.

===
## TODO:
* change variable names to be less generic
* create NPC and Ghost templates
* change Character layout slightly to accomodate GB logo and "photo"
