<h4>Ghostbuster Training Centers</h4>
	
<p>Following the events of The East Room Incursion, and the subsequent Bi-Partisan Ghostbuster Vocational Initiative (or Buster Bill), 15 Ghostbuster Training Centers (GTCs) were planned and built.  Initially, three facilities were built.</p>

<p>The first, unsurprisingly was built in New York, NY, and is the largest of the GTCs.  The second was built in Florida, while the third was constructed in Chicago.  The Chicago center was somewhat controversial due to the non-franchise nature of Dr. Yates and her team. Nevertheless, The Chicago CTC graduates are every bit as capable as their fellows.</p>

<p>Unless your campaignis set in one of the above locations, it is assumed that your GTC is one of the remaining 11 GTCs scattered across the U.S. (or the world, in case this ever gets popular).  Yes, eleven. "But wait: 15-3=12!" you say. yup. I haven't menttioned #13 yet.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>GTC #13</h3>

<p>GTC-13 was built in Savannah, GA.  It is listed as one of the top three "most haunted" cities in the United States.  No one is sure why exactly the 13th Trianing Center was built there.  Did someone overlook it? Disbelieve in sillt superstition? Or was it a statement of bravado?  A challemge, as it were, to the spirit world?</p>

<p>Regardless, GTC-13 was only operational for 1 week. After that, it was sealed completly, and it's remaining students reassigned to other Centers. All equipment and personal effects of staff and students were sealed inside by a special Oversight Team from the New York Headquarters.</p>

<p>Ghost Master's Note:  What's inside GTC-13?  That's up to you.  Maybe someday I'll come up with a module for it. Until then, have fun!  If you wind up making a GTC-13 adventure, send it to me.  I'll include it here and give you FULL CREDIT for it.</p>
