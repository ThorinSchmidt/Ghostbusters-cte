  <h3>GTC #13</h3>

  <p>GTC-13 was built in Savannah, GA, one of the top three "most haunted" 
    cities in the United States. No one is sure exactly why the 13th Training
    Center was built there. Did someone overlook it? Perhaps they disbelieved in
    "silly superstitions"? Or was it a statement of bravado; a challenge, as it 
    were, to the spirit world?</p>

  <p>Regardless, GTC-13 was only operational for 1 week. After that, it was 
    sealed completly, and its remaining students reassigned to other Centers. 
    All equipment and personal effects of staff and students were sealed inside
    by a special Oversight Team from the New York Headquarters.</p>

  <p class="gm_note"><b>Ghost Master's Note:</b> What's inside GTC-13? That's up to you. Maybe 
    someday I'll come up with a module for it. Until then, have fun!  If you 
    wind up making a GTC-13 adventure, send it to me; I'll include it here and 
    give you FULL CREDIT for it.</p>

<h1>Ghostbuster Training Centers</h1>

<p>Following the events of The East Room Incursion, and the subsequent Bi-
  Partisan Ghostbuster Vocational Initiative (or Buster Bill), 15 Ghostbuster 
  Training Centers (GTCs) were planned. Initially, three facilities were built.
  </p>

<p>The first, unsurprisingly, was built in New York, NY, and is the largest of 
  the GTCs. The second was built in Florida, while the third was constructed in
  Chicago. The Chicago center was somewhat controversial due to the non-
  franchise nature of Dr. Yates and her team. Nevertheless, The Chicago CTC 
  graduates are every bit as capable as their fellows.</p>

<p>Unless your campaign is set in one of the above locations, it is assumed that
  your GTC is one of the remaining 11 Centers scattered across the U.S. (or the
  world, in case this ever gets popular).  Yes, eleven. "But wait: 15-3=12!" you
  say. yup. I haven't menttioned #13 yet.</p>
  
<h2>Training Center Staff</h2>

<p class="level1">
  Each Training Center is different, and varies in the type and number of staff
  positions.  However, each center maintains a minimum of at least one of the
  following staff positions.</p>
  
<h3 class="level1">Required Positions</h3>

<h4 class="level2">Director</h4>

<p class="level3">This is the only position that is always filled by
  Ghostbusters International itself.  All other positions are usually hired
  locally by the Director, or an official head of HR.</p>

<p class="level3">The Director's role is to be the Captain of the Ship,
  providing overall direction for the Center, as well as being the Steady Rock
  when all Hell(sometimes lterally) breaks loose. It is not uncommon for this
  spot to be filled by former front-line Ghostbusters who are nearing retirement
  or who for various reasons desire to take a "less active" role within the
  organization.</p>

<h4 class="level2">Executive PA</h4>

<p class="level3">Some may dismiss this position as "Just a secretary". Don't 
  ever make that mistake where this person can hear you.  The Executive
  PA (often called simply "The PA") is the right hand of the Director, involved in all decisions, and the 
  primary mover and shaker of the Training Center's daily operations.</p>
  
<p class="level3">While The PA is not exactly in the official Business 
  Hierarchy, They are nevertheless the one to turn to in the abscence of the 
  Director.  Many an Assistant Director owes their success or failure to how 
  much or how little they heeded The PA's "advice" in a crisis.</p>
  
<h4 class="level2">Training Instructor</h4>

<p class="level3">The Training Instructor can either be a permanent position, 
  or one which is filled on a rotating basis by front-line Ghostbusters looking
  for a little time away from regular operations.</p>

<p class="level3">The training instructor's job is, of course, to instruct the
  future ghostbuster in the skills they will need to be an effective buster of 
  ghosts. This is done through a combination of traditional instruction, 
  practical demonstrations, realistic simulations, and hands-on experience.</p>
  
<p class="level3">Obviously, then, a good instructor is absolutely essential
  to the success of any program. Ideally, an instructor should combine the Cool 
  of Peter Venkman, the Brains of Egon Spengler and Ray Stanz, and the Muscles
  and Moves of Winston Zeddemore. (An ability to manifest the chutzpah of 
  Jeanine Melnitz would certainly be a great asset as well!)</p>
 
<h4 class="level2">Janitor</h4>
 
<p class="level3">A janitor is a necessary (and well-paid!) member of the staff.
  From Slime-covered uniforms, to strange glowing liquids tracked in on the 
  floors, a good janitor can handle it all.  While they are not out there 
  slinging plasma streams and throwing traps, you'd be surprised at the amount 
  of information can be picked up while operating on the background.</p>

<p class="level3">Don't let the job title fool you, though. While their primary
  job is maintaining a professionally clean workplace, the janitor can also be
  counted on to carry out routine maintenance and repair of equipment or to lend
  a hand to help complete construction of the latest gizmo or whizbang to come
  out of an eager student's mind. A good Jack-of-all-trades makes an invaluable
  janitor.</p>

<h3 class="level1">Secondary Positions</h3>

<h4 class="level2">Nurse</h4>
<h4 class="level2">Assistant Director</h4>
<h4 class="level2">Counselor</h4>
<h4 class="level2">HR Coordinator</h4>
<h4 class="level2">Paralegal</h4>
<h4 class="level2">PR Coordinator</h4>
<h4 class="level2">Recruitment Coordinator</h4>
<h4 class="level2">Civic Liason</h4>
<h4 class="level2">Safety/Security Officer</h4>
