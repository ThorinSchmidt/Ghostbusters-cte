<p>Following the events of The East Room Incursion, and the subsequent Bi-
  Partisan Ghostbuster Vocational Initiative (or Buster Bill), 15 Ghostbuster 
  Training Centers (GTCs) were planned. Initially, three facilities were built.
  </p>

<p>The first, unsurprisingly, was built in New York, NY, and is the largest of 
  the GTCs. The second was built in Florida, while the third was constructed in
  Chicago. The Chicago center was somewhat controversial due to the non-
  franchise nature of Dr. Yates and her team. Nevertheless, The Chicago CTC 
  graduates are every bit as capable as their fellows.</p>

<p>Unless your campaign is set in one of the above locations, it is assumed that
  your GTC is one of the remaining 11 Centers scattered across the U.S. (or the
  world, in case this ever gets popular).  Yes, eleven. "But wait: 15-3=12!" you
  say. yup. I haven't menttioned #13 yet.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>GTC #13</h3>

  <p>GTC-13 was built in Savannah, GA, one of the top three "most haunted" 
    cities in the United States. No one is sure exactly why the 13th Training
    Center was built there. Did someone overlook it? Perhaps they disbelieved in
    "silly superstitions"? Or was it a statement of bravado; a challenge, as it 
    were, to the spirit world?</p>

  <p>Regardless, GTC-13 was only operational for 1 week. After that, it was 
    sealed completly, and its remaining students reassigned to other Centers. 
    All equipment and personal effects of staff and students were sealed inside
    by a special Oversight Team from the New York Headquarters.</p>

  <p><b>Ghost Master's Note:</b> What's inside GTC-13? That's up to you. Maybe 
    someday I'll come up with a module for it. Until then, have fun!  If you 
    wind up making a GTC-13 adventure, send it to me; I'll include it here and 
    give you FULL CREDIT for it.</p>
